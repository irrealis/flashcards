      ##### 8.2d2: Telescoping Series
      **Motivating Example:** Use the $n$ th partial sum to determine if $S=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n(n+1)}$ converges or diverges. If it converges, find its sum.
    Back: |
      First note: we can rewrite the "summand" (terms $a_{n}$ that are being added up) using a partial fraction decomposition
      $$
      \frac{1}{n(n+1)}=\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+1}
      $$
      Then we have $S=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+1}\right)$.

      Write down the first few partial sums until you see a pattern of what cancels out and what is left behind. This gives us the $n$ th partial sum formula for the series:
      $$
      \begin{aligned}
      S_{n} &=\left(1-\frac{1}{2}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{3}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{4}\right)+\cdots+\left(\frac{1}{n-1}-\frac{1}{n}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+1}\right) \\
      &=1-\frac{1}{n+1}
      \end{aligned}
      $$

      Now that we have a function ($n$th term formula) for $S_{n}$, we can find $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} S_{n}$. **This limit will tell us if the sequence $\left\{S_{n}\right\}$ converges or diverges and, therefore, if the series converges or diverges:**
      $$
      \lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} S_{n}=\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)=1
      $$ (the limit exists and is a finite number). since the sequence of partial sums converges, the series also converges and they both converge to the value 1.

      The area contained in the rectangles (partial sums) traps all of the area under the curve.
      *Since the area under the curve is infinite, the area in the boxes (partial sums) is also infinite.* This is a geometric way of showing $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} S_{n}=\infty$ (the partial sums diverge).

      ##### 8.3d1: Convergence Tests for Positive Series
      **Theorem (The Integral Test):** Suppose $f(x)$ is a (?), (?), (?) function on $[1, \infty)$ and $a_{n}=f(n) .$ Then the series (?) if and only if the improper integral (?).

      **KEY:** The integral test only determines if the series converges or diverges. It does not say where the series converges to!

      **Theorem: (The Integral Test):** Suppose $f(x)$ is a continuous, positive, decreasing function on $[1, \infty)$ and $a_{n}=f(n) .$ Then the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}$ converges if and only if the improper integral $\int_{1}^{\infty} f(x) d x$ also converges.
