      APPM 1350 HW-07 01:
      The efficiency of a threaded fastener can be represented by
      $$$E=\frac{\lambda-k \lambda^{2}}{k+\lambda}, \quad \lambda>0$$$
      where $\lambda$ is the angle of pitch of the thread and $k$ is a positive constant. Find the critical number of $E,$ where the efficiency is maximized. Simplify your answer. (It is not necessary to confirm that there is a maximum value there.)

      Suppose $f$ and $g$ are differentiable functions on $[a, b]$ and that $f(a)=g(a)$ and $f(b)=g(b) .$
      (a) Show that there is at least one value of $c$ between $a$ and $b$ where $f^{\prime}(c)=g^{\prime}(c) .$
      (Hint: Apply Rolle's Theorem to $h(x)=f(x)-g(x) .)$
      (b) Let $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ and $g(x)=x^{2}$ on $[0,1]$. Find the value of $c$ that satisfies the result in part (a).
