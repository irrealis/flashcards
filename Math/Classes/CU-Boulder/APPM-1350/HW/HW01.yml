      Suppose voltage in the U.S. is represented by the function $V_{U}(t)=155 \sin (120 \pi t),$ where $t$ is measured in seconds, and voltage in Belgium is $V_{B}(t)=340 \sin (100 \pi t) .$ Find the maximum voltage and number of cycles per second in the two countries.

      (Hint: $\sin t$ has $1 /(2 \pi)$ cycles per second because its period is $2 \pi .$ )
    Back: |
      Maximum voltage: $V_{U} 155$ volts, $V_{B} 340$ volts. Cycles per second: $V_{U} 60, V_{B} 50.$

      (a) For what value of $h$ will $\sec \theta=3 / 2 ?$
      (b) What values of $\theta$ will satisfy $h / b<\sqrt{3} ?$

      Buffs Mobile offers a data plan with a monthly charge of $45 for the first \\(500 \mathrm{mb}\\) of use, plus $10 for each additional \\(100 \mathrm{mb}\\) (rounded up to the nearest \\(100 \mathrm{mb}.\\) For example, if a customer uses 0 or \\(500 \mathrm{mb}\\) of data the cost is $45, and if she uses \\(501 \mathrm{mb}\\) the cost is $55.

      (a) Express the monthly cost \\(C(m)\\) in dollars as a function of the number \\(m\\) of megabytes used, \\(0 \leq m \leq 1000.\\)
      (b) Sketch a graph of \\(C(m)\\) with tick marks clearly labeled.
    Back: |
      (a) \\(C(m)=\left\\{\begin{array}{ll}{45} & {0 \leq m \leq 500} \\\\ {45+10\lceil(m-500) / 100\rceil} & { 500<m \leq 1000}\end{array}\right.\\)
      where \\(\lceil x\rceil\\) equals the least integer greater than or equal to \\(x.\\)

      Rapunzel is 18 years old today and her hair is $70 \mathrm{ft}$ long. Her hair was 2 inches long at birth, then grew at a constant rate until it reached $40 \mathrm{ft}$ in length on her 12 th birthday. Since then Rapunzel's hair has grown at a different constant rate. Express Rapunzel's hair length $H,$ in feet, as a function of her age, $t,$ in years.

      $H(t)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}{\frac{1}{6}+\frac{239}{72} t,} & {0 \leq t \leq 12} \\ {5 t-20,} & {12<t \leq 18}\end{array}\right.$
