      APPM 1350 HW-10 01:
      Suppose we estimate the area under the curve $y=g(x)$ using four approximating rectangles.
      (a) Sketch the rectangles associated with (i) $L_{4},$ the left-endpoint rule, (ii) $M_{4},$ the midpoint rule, and (iii) the lower sum.
      (b) Does the left-endpoint approximation $L_{4}$ produce an underestimate or overestimate? Explain.

      Suppose the velocity function (in $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s})$ for a particle moving along a line is
      $$$
      v(t)=-t^{2}+2 t+3,0 \leq t \leq 4.

      (c) Without using absolute value, set up integral(s) to find the total distance traveled by the particle on $[0,4] .$

      Mr. McCloskey is driving his truck along a straight road when he notices a small dark object $500 \text{ ft}$ ahead. He steps on the brakes, then recognizes that the object is a duck standing in the middle of the road. The truck records his speed every 2 seconds after he applies the brakes until he stops after 10 seconds.
      $$$\begin{array}{c|cccccc}{\text { time } t( \text {sec) } } & {0} & {2} & {4} & {6} & {8} & {10} \\ \hline \text { speed (ftsec) } & {100} & {80} & {50} & {25} & {10} & {0}\end{array}$$$
      Is it possible that Mr. McCloskey hit the duck? Find lower, midpoint, and upper estimates for the total distance traveled by the truck before coming to a stop. Assume that the speed of the truck decreased throughout the 10-second period but not necessarily at a steady rate.
