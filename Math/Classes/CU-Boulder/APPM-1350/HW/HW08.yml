      APPM 1350 HW-08 01:
      The line $y=m x+b$ is called a slant asymptote if $f(x)-(m x+b) \rightarrow 0$ as $x \rightarrow \infty$ or $x \rightarrow-\infty$ because the vertical distance between the curve $y=f(x)$ and the line $y=m x+b$ approaches 0 as $x$ becomes large.

      For rational functions $P(x) / Q(x),$ a slant asymptote occurs when the degree of $P$ is one more than the degree of $Q .$ To find the asymptote, use long division to write the function in the form $m x+b+R(x) / Q(x).$

      Find an equation of the slant asymptote of the function $y=\frac{-9 x^{2}+15 x-1}{6 x-2} .$ Verify using appropriate limits.

      A round ring of wire is centered at the origin and lies in a plane perpendicular to the $x$ -axis. The electric field at $(x, 0)$ can be represented by
      $$$
      E=\frac{k x}{\left(x^{2}+R^{2}\right)^{3 / 2}}
      $$$
      where $R$ is the radius of the ring and $k$ is a positive constant. The field reaches maximum and minimum levels at what values of $x ?$
    Back: |
      $\min x=-R / \sqrt{2}, \max x=R / \sqrt{2}$

      A farmer is designing a grain silo that will be shaped like a cylinder topped by a hemispherical roof. Suppose the cost of building the roof will be twice as expensive (per square meter of surface area) than the cost of the sides. If the desired volume of the silo is $72 \pi \mathrm{m}^{3},$ what dimensions will minimize the cost?

      radius $3 \text{ m},$ height $6 \text{ m}$
