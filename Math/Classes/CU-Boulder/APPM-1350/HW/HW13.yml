      APPM 1350 HW-13-04:
      A dose of $2.5 \text{ mg}$ of a painkiller is administered to a patient. Suppose the rate at which the drug is eliminated from the body is proportional to the amount present. If the painkiller has a half-life of two hours, how long will it take for $90 \%$ of the drug to be eliminated?

      Without a calculator, approximate your final answer to the nearest tenth using the approximations $\ln 2 \approx 0.7, \ln 3 \approx 1.1,$ and $\ln 5 \approx 1.6$.

      $$$6.6 \text{ hrs}$$$

      A turnip is placed into a $200^{\circ}$ oven. After 30 minutes the turnip has a temperature of $120^{\circ}$ and is getting hotter at an instantaneous rate of $2^{\circ}/\text{min}$. What was the initial temperature of the turnip? Use a calculator or CAS for this.
    Back: |
      $$$30.6^{\circ}$$$

      There was a flu outbreak in River City. The number of people who came down with the flu $t$ days
      after the start of the outbreak was
      $$$
      P=\frac{10^{6}}{1+5000 e^{-t / 10}}.
      $$$
      (a) How many days did it take before 1000 people caught the flu?
      (b) Eventually how many people came down with the flu?
    Back: |
      (a) $16$ days
      (b) $1,000,000$ people
