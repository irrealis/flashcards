      APPM 1350 HW-09 01:
      Suppose Newton's Method is applied to the following function.
      $$$
      g(x)=
      \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
          {\sqrt{x-1}} & {\text { for } x \geq 1} \\
          {-\sqrt{1-x}} & {\text { for } x<1}
        \end{array}
      \right.
      $$$
      (a) First find $g^{\prime}(x) .$
      (b) Now apply Newton's Method to $g$ using an initial value of $x_{1}=0 .$ Without a calculator find the next four approximations.
      (c) Will Newton's Method converge to a root of $g ?$ Explain.
    Back: |
      (a) $g^{\prime}(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}{\frac{1}{2}(x-1)^{-1 / 2}} & {\text { for } x>1} \\ {\frac{1}{2}(1-x)^{-1 / 2}} & {\text { for } x<1}\end{array}\right.$
      (b) $x_{2}=2, x_{3}=0, x_{4}=2, x_{5}=0$
      (c) No.

      Newton's Method can be sensitive to small changes in starting values. Let $f(x)=\sin x-2 x / 3 .$
      $\square$ Apply Newton's Method using the three different initial values listed below. Round your results to five decimal places.
      (a) $x_{1}=0.82$
      (b) $x_{1}=0.905$
      (c) $x_{1}=0.91$

      A car traveling at $55 \mathrm{mph} \text { (about } 80 \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{sec})$ comes to a halt after five seconds, decelerating at a constant rate.
      (a) Graph the velocity function $v(t), 0 \leq t \leq 5,$ in ft/sec.
      (b) Use the graph to calculate the total stopping distance.
      (c) Confirm your answer using antiderivatives.

      On the moon the acceleration due to gravity is about $5 \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{sec}^{2} .$ Suppose a golf ball is shot straight up into the air with a velocity of $20 \mathrm{ft}$ sec from the top of a cliff $50 \mathrm{ft}$ high. If the ball lands at the base of the cliff, with what velocity will it hit the ground?
