      APPM 1350 HW-03 01:
      Sketch the graph of a single function $f$ that satisfies all of the following conditions:
      $\lim _{x \rightarrow-\infty} f(x)=-2$
      $\lim _{x \rightarrow 3^{-}} f(x)=-\infty$
      $\lim _{x \rightarrow \infty} f(x)=0$
      $\lim _{x \rightarrow 3^{+}} f(x)=2$
      $\lim _{x \rightarrow-3} f(x)=\infty$
      $f$ is right-continuous at 3

      Does the graph of $y=\frac{(1+x)\left(x-x^{2}\right)}{3 x^{3}+x}$ have horizontal or vertical asymptotes? Justify your answer using appropriate limits.
    Back: |
      The graph has no vertical asymptotes and a horizontal asymptote at $y=-\frac{1}{3}.$

      Is it possible to find constants $a$ and $b$ so that the function
      $$$
      f(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}{\frac{\sqrt{2} x\left(x^{2}-4\right)}{\left|x^{2}-4\right|},} & {x \neq \pm 2} \\ {a,} & {x=-2} \\ {b,} & {x=2}\end{array}\right.
      $$$
      is continuous? Use the definition of continuity to justify your answer.
    Back: |
      No, it is not possible.
