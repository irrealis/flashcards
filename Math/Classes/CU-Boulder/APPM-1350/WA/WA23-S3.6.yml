      Use Newton's method to approximate the given number correct to eight decimal places.

      \sqrt[6]{49}
      $$$$

      $1.91293118$

      ##### Full solution:

      To approximate $x=\sqrt[6]{49}\left(\text { so that } x^{6}=49\right),$ we can take $f(x)=x^{6}-49 .$ So $f^{\prime}(x)=6 x^{5},$ and thus, $x_{n+1}=x_{n}-\frac{x_{n}^{6}-49}{6 x_{n}^{5}} .$ Since $\sqrt[6]{64}=2$ and 49 is reasonably close to $64,$ we'll use $x_{1}=2 .$ We need to find approximations until they agree to eight decimal places. $x_{1}=2 \Rightarrow x_{2} \approx 1.92187500, x_{3} \approx 1.91303459,$ ...
      So $\sqrt[6]{49} \approx 1.91293118,$ to eight decimal places.

      (a) Use Newton's method with $x_{1}=1$ to find the root of the equation $x^{3}-x=4$ correct to six decimal places.
      (b) Solve the equation in part (a) using $x_{1}=0.6$ as the initial approximation.
      (c) Solve the equation in part (a) using $x_{1}=0.57 .$ ( You definitely need a programmable calculator for this part.)
      (d) Graph $f(x)=x^{3}-x-4$ and its tangent lines at $x_{1}=1,0.6,$ and $0.57 .$

      ##### Full solution:

      (a-c)
      $x^{3}-x=4 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad x^{3}-x-4=0 .$ $f(x)=x^{3}-x-4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad f^{\prime}(x)=3 x^{2}-1,$ so $x_{n+1}=x_{n}-\frac{x_{n}^{3}-x_{n}-4}{3 x_{n}^{2}-1} .$

      (d)
      From the figure, we see that the tangent line corresponding to $x_{1}=1$ results in a sequence of approximations that converges quite quickly $\left(x_{7} \approx x_{8}\right) .$ The tangent line corresponding to $x_{1}=0.6$ is close to being horizontal, so $x_{2}$ is quite far from the root. But the sequence still converges-just a little more slowly $\left(x_{14} \approx x_{15}\right) .$ Lastly, the tangent line corresponding to $x_{1}=0.57$ is very nearly horizontal, $x_{2}$ is farther away from the root, and the sequence takes more iterations to converge $\left(x_{21} \approx x_{22}\right) .$

      The graph of the derivative $f^{\prime}$ of a continuous function $f$ is shown. (Assume the function $f$ is defined only for $0<x<\infty,$ and that $f$ does not change behavior as it exits the graph to the right.)

      ##### Full solution:

      (a) $f$ is increasing where $f^{\prime}$ is positive, that is, on $(0,2),(4,6),$ and $(8, \infty)$ and decreasing where $f^{\prime}$ is negative, that is, on $(2,4)$ and $(6,8).$

      (b) $f$ has local maxima where $f^{\prime}$ changes from positive to negative, at $x=2$ and at $x=6,$ and local minima where $f^{\prime}$ changes from negative to positive, at $x=4$ and at $x=8.$

      (c) $f$ is concave upward $(\mathrm{CU})$ where $f^{\prime}$ is increasing, that is, on $(3,6)$ and $(6, \infty),$ and concave downward (CD) where $f^{\prime}$ is decreasing, that is, on $(0,3) .$

      (d) There is a point of inflection where $f$ changes from being $\mathrm{CD}$ to being $\mathrm{CU},$ that is, at $x=3.$
