      CCAC 04.06 00a: Describe **The First Derivative Test for Absolute Extreme Values**.
    Back: >
      Suppose that $c$ is a critical number of a continuous function $f$ defined on
      an interval.

      (a) If $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x < c$ and $f'(x) < 0$ for all $x > c$, then $f(x)$
      is the absolute maximum value of $f$.

      (b) If $f'(x) < 0$ for all $x < c$ and $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x > c$, then $f(x)$
      is the absolute minimum value of $f$.

      CCAC 04.06 33: In a beehive, each cell is a regular hexagonal prism, open at
      one end with a trihedral angle at the other end as in the figure. It is believed
      that bees form their cells in such a way as to minimize the surface area for
      a given volume, thus using the least amount of wax in cell construction. Examination
      of these cells has shown that the measure of the apex angle $\theta$ is amazingly
      consistent. Based on the geometry of the cell, it can be shown that the surface
      area $S$ is given by

      S = 6sh - \tfrac{3}{2}s^2 \cot \theta + (3s^2\sqrt{3}/2) \csc \theta

      CCAC 04.06 59: Ornithologists have determined that some species of birds tend
      to avoid flights over large bodies of water during daylight hours. It is believed
      that more energy is required to fly over water than over land because air generally
      rises over land and falls over water during the day. A bird with these tendencies
      is released from an island that is $\text{5 km}$ from the nearest point $B$
      on a straight shoreline, flies to a point $C$ on the shoreline, and then flies
      along the shoreline to its nesting area $D$. Assume that the bird instinctively
      chooses a path that will minimize its energy expenditure. Points $B$ and $D$
      are $\text{13 km}$ apart.

      (a) In general, if it takes 1.4 times as much energy to fly over water as it
      does over land, to what point $C$ should the bird fly in order to minimize the
      total energy expended in returning to its nesting area?

      (b) Let $W$ and $L$ denote the energy (in joules) per kilometer flown over water
      and land, respectively. What would a large value of the ratio $W/L$ mean in
      terms of the bird's flight? What would a small value mean? Determine the ratio
      $W/L$ corresponding to the minimum expenditure of energy.

      (c) What should the value of $W/L$ be in order for the bird to fly directly
      to its nesting area $D$? What should the value of $W/L$ be for the bird to fly
      to $B$ and then along the shore to $D$?

      (d) If the ornithologists observe that birds of a certain species reach the
      shore at a point $\text{4 km}$ from $B$, how many times more energy does it
      take a bird to fly over water than over land?
