      CCAC 04.07 00a: What does **Newton's Method** approximate? Give the successive approximation.
    Back: |
      **Newton's Method** tries to find successively better approximations to roots of a real-valued function $f(x)$. For approximation $x_n$, the next is given by
      $$$$
      x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}
      $$$$

      CCAC 04.07 01: The figure shows the graph of a function $f$. Suppose that Newton's
      method is used to approximate the root $r$ of the equation $f(x) = 0$ with initial
      approximation $x_1 = 1$.

      (a) Draw the tangent lines that are used to find $x_2$ and $x_3$, and estimate
      the numerical values of $x_2$ and $x_3$.

      (b) Would $x_1 = 5$ be a better first approximation? Explain.

      when $x = 3$. If Newton's method is used to locate a root of the equation $f(x)
      = 0$ and the initial approximation is $x_1 = 3$, find the second approximation
      $x_2$.

      CCAC 04.07 33: A car dealer sells a new car for $18,000. He also offers to sell the same car for payments of $375 per month for five years. What monthly interest rate is this dealer charging?
      To solve this problem you will need to use the formula for the present value \\(A\\) of an annuity consisting of \\(n\\) equal payments of size \\(R\\) with interest rate \\(i\\) per time period:
      \\[
      A = \frac{R}{i}[1 - (1 + i)^{-n}]
      \\]
      Replacing \\(i\\) by \\(x\\), show that
      \\[
      48x(1 + x)^{60} - (1 + x)^{60} + 1 = 0
      \\]
      Use Newton's method to solve this equation.
