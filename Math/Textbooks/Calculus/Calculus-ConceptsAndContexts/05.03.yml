      CCAC 05.03 00b: Define **indefinite integral**.
    Back: |
      The notation $\int{f(x)\,dx}$ is traditionally used for an antiderivative of $f$ and is called an **indefinite integral**. Thus
      $$$$
      \int{f(x)\,dx} = F(x) \qquad \text{means} \qquad F'(x) = f(x).
      $$$$
      The connection between the definite and indefinite integral is given by the Evaluation Theorem: If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, then
      $$$$
      \int_{a}^{b} {f(x) \, dx} = \left. \int {f(x) \, dx} \right]_{a}^{b}
      $$$$

      The integral of a rate of change is the net change:
      $$$$
      \int_{a}^{b} {F'(x) \, dx} = F(b) - F(a)
      $$$$
      This is simply a reformulation of the Evaluation Theorem.

      CCAC 05.03 69: Economists use a cumulative distribution called a _Lorenz curve_
      to describe the distribution of income between households in a given country.
      Typically, a Lorenz curve is defined on $[0,1]$ with endpoints $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$,
      and is continuous, increasing, and concave upward. The points on this curve
      are determined by ranking all households by income and then computing the percentage
      of households whose income is less than or equal to a given percentage of the
      total income of the country. For example, the point $(a/100,b/100)$ is on the
      Lorenz curve if the bottom $a$% of the households receive less than or equal
      to $b$% of the total income. _Absolute equality_ of income distribution would
      occur if the bottom $a$% of the households receive $a$% of the income, in which
      case the Lorenz curve would be the line $y = x$.  The area between the Lorenz
      curve and the line $y = x$ measures how much the income distribution differs
      from absolute equality. The _coefficient of inequality_ is the ratio of the
      area between the Lorenz curve and the line $y = x$ to the area under $y = x$.

      ![](CCAC-05.03-69.1.jpg)

      (a) Show that the coefficient of inequality is twice the area between the Lorenz
      curve and the line $y = x$, that is, show that

      (b) The income distribution of a certain country is represented by the Lorenz
      curve defined by the equation

      L(x) = \tfrac{5}{12}x^2 + \tfrac{7}{12}x
