      CCAC 02.8 01: The graph of the derivative $f'$ of a function $f$ is shown.
      (a) On what intervals is $f$ increasing? Decreasing?
      (b) At what values of $x$ does $f$ have a local maximum? Local minimum?
      (c) If it is known that $f(0) = 0$, sketch a possible graph of $f$.

      (a) Increasing on $(0,1)$, $(4,5)$. Decreasing on $(1,4)$.
      (b) Local maximum at $x = 1$. Local minimum at $x = 4$.
      (c)

      CCAC 02.8 09: The president announces that the national deficit is increasing,
      but at a decreasing rate. Interpret this statement in terms of a function and
      its derivatives.
    Back: |
      If $D(t)$ is the size of the deficit as a function of time, then at the time of the speech $D'(t) > 0$, but $D''(t) < 0$.

      CCAC 02.8 11: The table gives population densities for ring-necked pheasants (in number of pheasants per acre) on Pelee Island, Ontario.
      (a) Describe how the rate of change of population varies.
      (b) Estimate the inflection points of the graph. What is the significance of these points?

      (a) The rate starts small, grows rapidly, levels off, then decreases and becomes
      negative.

      (b) $(1932, 2.5)$ and $(1937, 4.3)$; the rate of change of population density
      starts to decrease in 1932 and starts to increase in 1937.

      CCAC 02.8 13: Let $K(t)$ be a measure of the knowledge you gain by studying
      for a test for $t$ hours. Which do you think is larger, $K(8) - K(7)$ or $K(3)
      - K(2)$? Is the graph of $K$ concave upward, or concave downward? Why?
    Back: |
      $K(3) - K(2)$; concave downward.
