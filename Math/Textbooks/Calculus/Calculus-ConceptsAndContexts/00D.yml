      CCAC 00.D (Trigonometry) 07a: Prove the identity:
      $$
      \tan \theta \sin \theta + \cos \theta = \sec \theta.
      $$
    Back: |
      This bears similarity to the identity $\sin^2{\theta} + \cos^2{\theta} = 1$, if we substitute the definitions of $\tan$ and $\sec$, so we will use the following identities, in order, to transform the left side to the right:
      $$
      \tan{\theta} = \frac{\sin{\theta}}{\cos{\theta}}
      $$
      $$
      \sin^2{\theta} + \cos^2{\theta} = 1
      $$
      $$
      \frac{1}{\cos{\theta}} = \sec{\theta}
      $$

      First we transform $\tan{\theta}$:
      $$
      \tan \theta \sin \theta + \cos \theta
      $$
      $$
      = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} \sin \theta + \cos \theta
      $$
      Then seek a common denominator:
      $$
      = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}  \sin \theta + \frac{\cos \theta}{\cos \theta}\cos \theta
      $$
      And simplify:
      $$
      = \frac{\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta}{\cos \theta}
      $$
      And substitute $\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$:
      $$
      = \frac{1}{\cos \theta}
      $$
      The result is, by definition, $\sec \theta$.

      CCAC 00.D (Trigonometry) 07b: Prove the identity:
      $$
      \frac{2 \tan x}{1 + \tan^2 x} = \sin 2x.
      $$
    Back: |
      Some things to note:

      - The left side is a function of $x$, while the right side is a function of $2x$. This suggests the double-angle formula.
      - The denominator of the left side is part of the identity $\tan^2{\theta} + 1 = \sec^2{\theta}$, which suggests transformation.
      - From there we may make progress using definitions of $\tan$ and $\sec$.

      So we will use the following identities, in order, to transform the right side to the left:
      $$
      \sin{2\theta} = 2\sin{\theta}\cos{\theta}
      $$
      $$
      \frac{\sin{\theta}}{\cos{\theta}} = \tan{\theta}
      $$
      $$
      \cos{\theta} = \frac{1}{\sec{\theta}}
      $$
      $$
      \sec^2{\theta} = \tan^2{\theta} + 1
      $$

      First we transform $\sin{2x}$:
      $$
      \sin{2x} = 2\sin{x}\cos{x}
      $$
      Then multiply by $1 = \frac{\cos x}{\cos x}$:
      $$
      = \frac{2\sin{x}\cos^2{x}}{\cos x}
      $$
      And substitute $\frac{\sin{x}}{\cos{x}} = \tan{x}$:
      $$
      = 2 \tan x \cos^2 x
      $$
      Now substitute $\cos{x} = \frac{1}{\sec{x}}$:
      $$
      = \frac{2 \tan x}{\sec^2 x}
      $$
      And finally substitute $\sec^2{x} = \tan^2{x} + 1$:
      $$
      = \frac{2 \tan x}{\tan^2 x + 1}.
      $$
