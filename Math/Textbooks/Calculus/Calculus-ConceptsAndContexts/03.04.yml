      CCAC 03.04 00a: State the **Chain Rule** of differentiation.

      If $g$ is differentiable at $x$, and $f$ is differentiable at $g(x)$, then the composite function $F = f \circ g$ is differentiable at $x$, and $F'$ is given by the product
      $$$$
      F'(x) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x).
      $$$$
      In Leibniz notation, if $y = f(u)$ and $u = g(x)$ are both differentiable functions, then
      $$$$
      \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \frac{du}{dx}.
      $$$$
