      CCAC 05.04 00a: State the **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**.
    Back: |
      Suppose $f$ is continuous on the interval $[a,b]$.

      (1) The function $F$ defined by
      $$$$
      F(x) = \int_{a}^{x} {f(t) \, dt}
      $$$$
      is an antiderivative of $f$, that is, $F' = f$.

      (2) For any antiderivative $F$ of $f$, that is, $F' = f$,
      $$$$
      \int_{a}^{b} {f(x) \, dx} = F(b) - F(a).
      $$$$

      Part (1) can be rewritten using Leibniz notation as
      $$$$
      \frac{d}{dx} \int_{a}^{x} {f(t) \, dt} = f(x),
      $$$$
      and part (2) can be rewritten as
      $$$$
      \int_{a}^{b} {F'(x) \, dx} = F(b) - F(a).
      $$$$
      which is the Net Change Theorem.

      CCAC 05.04 33: A manufacturing company owns a major piece of equipment that depreciates at the (continuous) rate $f = f(t)$, where $t$ is the time measured in months since its last overhaul. Because a fixed cost $A$ is incurred each time the machine is overhauled, the company wants to determine the optimal time $T$ (in months) between overhauls.

      (a) Explain why $\int_0^t f(s) \,ds$ represents the loss in value of the  machine over the period of time $t$ since the last overhaul.

      (b) Let $C = C(t)$ be given by
      $$$$
      C(t) = \frac{1}{t} \left[ A + \int_0^t f(s) \,ds \right]
      $$$$
      What does $C$ represent and why would the company want to minimize $C$?

      (c) Show that $C$ has a minimum value at the numbers $t = T$ where $C(T) = f(T)$.
