      CCAC 03.09 01: The turkey in CCAC-3.9 Example 1 is removed from the oven when
      its temperature reaches $185 \mathrm{^\circ F}$ and is placed on a table in
      a room where the temperature is $75 \mathrm{^\circ F}$. After 10 minutes the
      temperature of the turkey is $172 \mathrm{^\circ F}$, and after 20 minutes it
      is $160 \mathrm{^\circ F}$. Use a linear approximation to predict the temperature
      of the turkey after half an hour. Do you think your prediction is an overestimate
      or an underestimate? Why?
    Back: |
      $148 \mathrm{^\circ F}$; underestimate.

      CCAC 03.09 33: When blood flows along a blood vessel, the flux $F$ (the volume
      of blood per unit time that flows past a given point) is proportional to the
      fourth power of the radius $R$ of the blood vessel:

      $$$$

      F = kR^4

      $$$$

      (This is known as Poiseuille's Law; we will show why it is true in CCAC-6.7.)
      A partially clogged artery can be expanded by an operation called angioplasty,
      in which a balloon-tipped catheter is inflated inside the artery in order to
      widen it and restore the normal blood flow.

      Show that the relative change in $F$ is about four times the relative change
      in $R$. How will a $5\%$ increase in the radius affect the blood flow?
    Back: |
      A $5\%$ increase in the radius corresponds to a $20\%$ increase in blood flow.
