      $$
      x=x(t) \quad y=y(t) \quad a \leqslant t \leqslant b

      $$ if this limit exists.

      This integral is also known as the **line integral with respect to arc length**.

      - $f$ is continuous on $C.$

      Questions for professor:

      - We often use "continuous" as a shorthand for a broader set of conditions under which a function $f$ is integrable, including as "piecewise continuous", "continuous except for a finite number of jump discontinuoities", or "continuous except possibly at the boundaries". Other than "$f$ is integrable", is there a succinct summary of these broader conditions?

      Just as for an ordinary single integral, we can interpret the line integral of a _positive_ function as an area. In fact, if $f(x, y) \geqslant 0,$ $\int_{C} f(x, y) d s$ represents the area of one side of the "fence" or "curtain" whose base is $C$ and whose height above the point $(x, y)$ is $f(x, y),$ as in the figure below.

      In general, a given parametrization $x=x(t), y=y(t), a \leqslant t \leqslant b,$ determines an orientation of a curve $C,$ with the positive direction corresponding to increasing values of the parameter $t$.

      If $-C$ denotes the curve consisting of the same points as $C$ but with the opposite orientation (from initial point $B$ to terminal point $A$ in the following figure), then we have
      $$
      \int_{-C} f(x, y) d x=-\int_{C} f(x, y) d x \quad \int_{-C} f(x, y) d y=-\int_{C} f(x, y) d y

      But if we integrate with respect to arc length, the value of the line integral does $n o t$ change when we reverse the orientation of the curve:
      $$
      \int_{-C} f(x, y) d s=\int_{C} f(x, y) d s
      $$ This is because $\Delta s_{i}$ is always positive, whereas $\Delta x_{i}$ and $\Delta y_{i}$ change sign when we reverse the orientation of $C.$

      Let $\mathbf{F}$ be a continuous vector field defined on a smooth curve $C$ given by a vector function $\mathbf{r}(t),$ $a \leqslant t \leqslant b .$ Then the line integral of $\mathbf{F}$ along $C$ is
      $$
      \int_{C} \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{r}=\int_{a}^{b} \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}(t)) \cdot \mathbf{r}^{\prime}(t) d t=\int_{C} \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{T} d s
      $$

      Remember that $\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}(t))$ is just an abbreviation for $\mathbf{F}(x(t), y(t), z(t)),$ so we evaluate $\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}(t))$ simply by putting $x=x(t), y=y(t),$ and $z=z(t)$ in the expression for $\mathbf{F}(x, y, z) .$ Notice also that we can formally write $d \mathbf{r}=\mathbf{r}^{\prime}(t) d t.$

      Hypotheses:

      - $C$ is a smooth curve $C$ given by a vector function $\mathbf{r}(t),$ $a \leqslant t \leqslant b .$
      - $\mathbf{F}$ be a continuous vector field on $C.$

      Even though $\int_{C} \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{r}=\int_{C} \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{T} d s$ and integrals with respect to arc length are unchanged when orientation is reversed, it is still true that
      $$
      \int_{-C} \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{r}=-\int_{C} \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{r}
      $$ because the unit tangent vector $\mathbf{T}$ is replaced by its negative when $C$ is replaced by $-C.$

      Hypotheses:

      - $C$ is a smooth curve $C$ given by a vector function $\mathbf{r}(t),$ $a \leqslant t \leqslant b .$
      - $\mathbf{F}$ be a continuous vector field on $C.$

      Suppose the vector field $\mathbf{F}$ on $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is given in component form by the equation $\mathbf{F}=P \mathbf{i}+Q \mathbf{j}+R \mathbf{k} .$ Then
      $$
      \int_{C} \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{r}=\int_{C} P d x+Q d y+R d z \quad \text { where } \mathbf{F}=P \mathbf{i}+Q \mathbf{j}+R \mathbf{k}
      $$

      Hypotheses:

      - $\mathbf{F}=P \mathbf{i}+Q \mathbf{j}+R \mathbf{k}$ is continuous on $\mathbf{r}(t).$
      - $\mathbf{r}(t)$ is a smooth curve.
