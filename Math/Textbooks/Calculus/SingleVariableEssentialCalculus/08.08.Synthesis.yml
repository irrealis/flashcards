      What are three methods for estimating the size of the error of a Taylor approximation?
    Back: |
      When using a Taylor polynomial $T_{n}$ to approximate a function $f,$ we have to ask the questions: How good an approximation is it? How large should we take $n$ to be in order to achieve a desired accuracy? To answer these questions we need to look at the absolute value of the remainder:
      $$
      \left|R_{n}(x)\right|=\left|f(x)-T_{n}(x)\right|
      $$ There are three possible methods for estimating the size of the error:
      1. If a graphing device is available, we can use it to graph $\left|R_{n}(x)\right|$ and thereby estimate the error.
      2. If the series happens to be an alternating series, we can use the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem.
      3. In all cases we can use Taylor's Formula, which says that
      $$
      R_{n}(x)=\frac{f^{(n+1)}(z)}{(n+1) !}(x-a)^{n+1}
      $$ where $z$ is a number that lies between $x$ and $a.$
