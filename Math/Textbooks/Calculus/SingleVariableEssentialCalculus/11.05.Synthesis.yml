      (a)

      Suppose that $z=f(x, y)$ is a differentiable function of $x$ and $y,$ where $x=g(s, t)$ and $y=h(s, t)$ are differentiable functions of $s$ and $t .$ Then
      $$
      \frac{\partial z}{\partial s}=\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} \frac{\partial x}{\partial s}+\frac{\partial z}{\partial y} \frac{\partial y}{\partial s}
      $$ and
      $$
      \frac{\partial z}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} \frac{\partial x}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial z}{\partial y} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}
      $$
      Hypotheses:

      - $z=f(x, y)$ is a differentiable function of $x$ and $y.$
      - $x=g(s, t)$ and $y=h(s, t)$ are differentiable functions of $s$ and $t .$

      (b)

      This version of the Chain Rule contains three types of variables: $s$ and $t$ are **independent** variables, $x$ and $y$ are called **intermediate** variables, and $z$ is the **dependent** variable.

      Notice that Case 2 has one term for each intermediate variable and each of these terms resembles the one-dimensional Chain Rule, Case 1.

      To remember the Chain Rule it's helpful to draw the **tree diagram** below.
      <p align="center">
      ![](SVEC-11.05-04.Sy.1.jpg)
      </p>
      We draw branches from the dependent variable $z$ to the intermediate variables $x$ and $y$ to indicate that $z$ is a function of $x$ and $y .$ Then we draw branches from $x$ and $y$ to the independent variables $s$ and $t .$ On each branch we write the corresponding partial derivative. To find $\partial z / \partial s$ we find the product of the partial derivatives along each path from $z$ to $s$ and then add these products:
      $$
      \frac{\partial z}{\partial s}=\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} \frac{\partial x}{\partial s}+\frac{\partial z}{\partial y} \frac{\partial y}{\partial s}
      $$ Similarly, we find $\partial z / \partial t$ by using the paths from $z$ to $t.$

      Suppose that $u$ is a differentiable function of the $n$ variables $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}$ and each $x_{j}$ is a differentiable function of the $m$ variables $t_{1}, t_{2}, \ldots, t_{m} .$ Then $u$ is a function of $t_{1}, t_{2}, \ldots, t_{m}$ and
      $$
      \frac{\partial u}{\partial t_{i}}=\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_{1}} \frac{\partial x_{1}}{\partial t_{i}}+\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_{2}} \frac{\partial x_{2}}{\partial t_{i}}+\cdots+\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_{n}} \frac{\partial x_{n}}{\partial t_{i}}
      $$ for each $i=1,2, \ldots, m.$

      Notice that each $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t_{i}}$ is written with $n$ terms, one for each intermediate variable.


      Hypotheses:

      - $u$ is a differentiable function of $x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}.$
      - Each $x_{j}$ is a differentiable function of $t_{1}, \ldots, t_{m}.$

      State the **Implicit Function Theorem** for $F(x,y) = 0$. List its hypotheses and conclusions.
    Back: |
      Suppose $F(x, y)=0$ defines $y$ implicitly as a differentiable function of $x,$ that is, $y=f(x),$ where $F(x, f(x))=0$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f .$ If $F$ is differentiable then
      $$
      \frac{d y}{d x}=-\frac{\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}}{\frac{\partial F}{\partial y}}=-\frac{F_{x}}{F_{y}}
      $$
      Intermediate hypotheses:

      - $F(x, y)=0$ implicitly defines $y = f(x)$ where $F(x, f(x))=0$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f .$ 
      - $F$ is differentiable.

      The conditions under which these assumptions are valid are given by the **Implicit Function Theorem**:

      If $F$ is defined on a disk containing $(a, b),$ where $F(a, b)=0, F_{y}(a, b) \neq 0,$ and $F_{x}$ and $F_{y}$ are continuous on the disk, then the equation $F(x, y)=0$ defines $y$ as a function of $x$ near the point $(a, b)$ and the derivative of this function is given by the implicit differentiation formula above.

      Hypotheses:

      - $F$ is defined on a disk containing $(a,b).$
      - $F(a,b) = 0.$
      - $F_y(a,b) \ne 0.$
      - $F_x$ and $F_y$ are continuous on the disk.

      Conclusions:

      - $F(x, y)=0$ implicitly defines a function $y = f(x)$ near $(a, b).$
      - $dy/dx$ is given by the formula above, that is,
        $$
        \frac{d y}{d x} = -\frac{F_{x}}{F_{y}}
        $$

      Suppose that $z$ is given implicitly as a function $z=f(x, y)$ by an equation of the form $F(x, y, z)=0 .$ This means that $F(x, y, f(x, y))=0$ for all $(x, y)$ in the domain of $f .$ If $F$ and $f$ are differentiable then
      $$
      \frac{\partial z}{\partial x}=-\frac{\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}}{\frac{\partial F}{\partial z}} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial z}{\partial y}=-\frac{\frac{\partial F}{\partial y}}{\frac{\partial F}{\partial z}}
      $$

      Intermediate hypotheses:

      - $F(x, y, z)=0$ implicitly defines a function $z = f(x, y).$

      - $F$ is differentiable.
      - $f$ is differentiable.

If $F$ is defined within a sphere containing $(a, b, c),$ where $F(a, b, c)=0,$ $F_{z}(a, b, c) \neq 0,$ and $F_{x}, F_{y},$ and $F_{z}$ are continuous inside the sphere then the equation $F(x, y, z)=0$ defines $z$ as a function of $x$ and $y$ near the point $(a, b, c)$ and this function is differentiable, with partial derivatives given by the implicit differentiation formula above.

      Hypotheses:

      - $F$ is defined within a sphere containing $(a, b, c).$
      - $F(a, b, c)=0.$
      - $F_{z}(a, b, c) \neq 0.$

      - $f$ is differentiable, with partial derivatives given by the implicit differentiation formula above, that is,
        $$
        \frac{\partial z}{\partial x}=-\frac{F_x}{F_z} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial z}{\partial y}=-\frac{F_y}{F_z}
        $$
