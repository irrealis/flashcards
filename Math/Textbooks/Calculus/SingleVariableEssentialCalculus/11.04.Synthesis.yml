      Suppose a surface $S$ has equation $z=f(x, y),$ where $f$ has continuous first partial derivatives, and let $P\left(x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0}\right)$ be a point on $S .$ As in the preceding section, let $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ be the curves obtained by intersecting the vertical planes $y=y_{0}$ and $x=x_{0}$ with the surface $S .$ Then the point $P$ lies on both $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$. Let $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ be the tangent lines to the curves $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ at the point $P .$ Then the **tangent plane** to the surface $S$ at the point $P$ is defined to be the plane that contains both tangent lines $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$. (See figure below.)

      An equation of the tangent plane to the graph of function $f$ of two variables at the point $(a, b, f(a, b))$ is
      $$
      z=f(a, b)+f_{x}(a, b)(x-a)+f_{y}(a, b)(y-b)

      $$
      L(x, y)=f(a, b)+f_{x}(a, b)(x-a)+f_{y}(a, b)(y-b)
      $$ is called the **linearization** of $f$ at $(a, b),$ and the approximation
      $$
      f(x, y) \approx f(a, b)+f_{x}(a, b)(x-a)+f_{y}(a, b)(y-b)
      $$ is called the **linear approximation** or the **tangent plane approximation** of $f$ at $(a, b).$

      Consider a function of two variables, $z=f(x, y),$ and suppose $x$ changes from $a$ to $a+\Delta x$ and $y$ changes from $b$ to $b+\Delta y .$ Then the corresponding **increment** of $z$ is
      $$
      \Delta z=f(a+\Delta x, b+\Delta y)-f(a, b)
      $$ Thus the increment $\Delta z$ represents the change in the value of $f$ when $(x, y)$ changes from $(a, b)$ to $(a+\Delta x, b+\Delta y) .$

    Back: |
      If $z=f(x, y),$ then $f$ is **differentiable** at $(a, b)$ if $\Delta z$ can be expressed in the form
      $$
      \Delta z=f_{x}(a, b) \Delta x+f_{y}(a, b) \Delta y+\varepsilon_{1} \Delta x+\varepsilon_{2} \Delta y
      $$ where $\varepsilon_{1}$ and $\varepsilon_{2} \rightarrow 0$ as $(\Delta x, \Delta y) \rightarrow(0,0).$

      This says that a differentiable function is one for which the linear approximation is a good approximation when $(x, y)$ is near $(a, b).$ In other words, the tangent plane approximates the graph of $f$ well near the point of tangency.

      Hypotheses:

      - $\Delta z$ can be expressed in the form
        $$
        \Delta z=f_{x}(a, b) \Delta x+f_{y}(a, b) \Delta y+\varepsilon_{1} \Delta x+\varepsilon_{2} \Delta y
        $$ where $\varepsilon_{1}$ and $\varepsilon_{2} \rightarrow 0$ as $(\Delta x, \Delta y) \rightarrow(0,0).$

      For a differentiable function of two variables, $z=f(x, y),$ we define the differentials $d x$ and $d y$ to be independent variables; that is, they can be given any values. Then the differential $d z,$ also called the total differential, is defined by
      $$
      d z=f_{x}(x, y) d x+f_{y}(x, y) d y=\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} d x+\frac{\partial z}{\partial y} d y.
      $$ Sometimes the notation $d f$ is used in place of $d z.$

      Hypotheses:

      - $f$ is differentiable at $(x,y).

      ###### Functions of Three or More Variables
      Define **linear approximation**, **linearization**, **increment**, **differentiability**, and **differential** of a function of three or more variables. List their hypotheses.
    Back: |
      As for functions of two variables, linear approximations, differentiability, and differentials can be defined for functions of more than two variables.

      If $u = f(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$, then $f$ is **differentiable** at $(a_1,\ldots,a_n)$ if the **increment**
      $$
      \Delta u = f(a_1 + \Delta x_1, \ldots, a_n + \Delta x_n) - f(a_1, \ldots, a_n)
      $$ can be expressed in the form
      $$
      \begin{aligned}
      \Delta u
      &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left[ f_i(a_1, \ldots, a_n) + \varepsilon_i \right] \Delta x_i \\
      &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} + \varepsilon_i \right) \Delta x_i \\
      \end{aligned}
      $$ where $\varepsilon_1, \ldots, \varepsilon_n \rightarrow 0$ as $(\Delta x_1, \ldots, \Delta x_n) \rightarrow \mathbf{0}.$

      If the partial derivatives $f_1,\ldots,f_n$ exist and are continuous near $(a_1,\ldots,a_n),$ then $f$ is differentiable at $(a_1,\ldots,a_n).$

      For such functions the **linear approximation** is
      $$
      \begin{aligned}
      f(x_1, \ldots, x_n)
      &\approx f(a_1, \ldots, a_n) + \sum_{i=1}^{n}f_i(a_1, \ldots, a_n)(x_i - a_i) \\
      &= f(a_1, \ldots, a_n) + \sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i}(x_i - a_i) 
      \end{aligned}
      $$ and the **linearization** $L(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ is the right side of this expression.

      The **total differential** $du$ is defined in terms of the differentials $dx_1, \ldots, dx_n$ of the independent variables by
      $$
      du = \sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i(a_1,\ldots,a_n)dx_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i}dx_i,
      $$ and by writing $dx_i = (x_i - a_i),$ the linear approximation can be written in terms of differentials:
      $$
      \begin{aligned}
      f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)
      &\approx f(a_1,\ldots,a_n) + du \\
      &= f(a_1,\ldots,a_n) + \sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i}dx_i \\
      &= f(a_1, \ldots, a_n) + \sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i(a_1, \ldots, a_n)(x_i - a_i)
      \end{aligned}
      $$
      Hypotheses:

      - The partial derivatives $f_1,\ldots,f_n$ exist near $(a_1,\ldots,a_n).$
      - The partial derivatives $f_1,\ldots,f_n$ are continuous near $(a_1,\ldots,a_n).$
