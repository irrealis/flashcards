      If $f$ is continuous on $[a, b],$ then the function $g$ defined by
      $$$
      g(x)=\int_{a}^{x} f(t) d t \quad a \leqslant x \leqslant b
      $$$ is an antiderivative of $f,$ that is, $g^{\prime}(x)=f(x)$ for $a<x<b.$

      Suppose $f$ is continuous on [a,b].
      1. If $g(x)=\int_{a}^{x} f(t) d t,$ then $g^{\prime}(x)=f(x).$
      2. $\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x=F(b)-F(a),$ where $F$ is any antiderivative of $f,$ that is, $F^{\prime}=f.$

      We regard Part 1 as fundamental because it relates integration and differentiation. But the Evaluation Theorem from Section 4.3 also relates integrals and derivatives, so we rename it as Part 2 of the Fundamental Theorem.

      Part 1 can be rewritten as
      $$$
      \frac{d}{d x} \int_{a}^{x} f(t) d t=f(x)
      $$$ which says that if $f$ is integrated and the result is then differentiated, we arrive back at the original function $f .$

      In Section 4.3 we reformulated Part 2 as the Net Change Theorem:
      $$$
      \int_{a}^{b} F^{\prime}(x) d x=F(b)-F(a)
      $$$ This version says that if we take a function $F,$ first differentiate it, and then integrate the result, we arrive back at the original function $F,$ but in the form $F(b)-F(a) .$

      Taken together, the two parts of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus say that differentiation and integration are inverse processes. Each undoes what the other does.
