      #### Taylor and Maclaurin Series
      Define **Taylor Coefficients**, **Taylor series of the function $f$ at $a$**, and **Maclaurin series of the function $f$**.
    Back: |
      Taylor coefficients are the numbers
      $$
      c_{n}=\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n !}
      $$ appearing in the (unnamed) Taylor coefficients theorem.

      If $f$ has a power-series expansion at $a$ then the Taylor series of the function $f$ at $a$ is
      $$
      \begin{aligned}
      f(x)
      &=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n !}(x-a)^{n} \\
      &=f(a)+\frac{f^{\prime}(a)}{1 !}(x-a)+\frac{f^{\prime \prime}(a)}{2 !}(x-a)^{2}+\frac{f^{\prime \prime \prime}(a)}{3 !}(x-a)^{3}+\cdots
      \end{aligned}
      $$

      For the special case $a=0$ the Taylor series becomes
      $$
      f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n !} x^{n}=f(0)+\frac{f^{\prime}(0)}{1 !} x+\frac{f^{\prime \prime}(0)}{2 !} x^{2}+\cdots
      $$ and is given the special name Maclaurin series.

      The remainder term
      $$
      R_{n}(x)=\frac{f^{(n+1)}(z)}{(n+1) !}(x-a)^{n+1}
      $$ appearing in the Taylor Remainder Theorem is known as Lagrange's form of the remainder term, and is very similar to the terms in the Taylor series except that $f^{(n+1)}$ is evaluated at $z$ instead of at $a$. All we can say about the number $z$ is that it lies somewhere between $x$ and $a .$

      Define **binomial series** and **binomial coefficients**.
    Back: |
      The Maclaurin series of $f(x)=(1+x)^{k}$ is
      $$
      \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n !} x^{n}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{k(k-1) \cdots(k-n+1)}{n !} x^{n}
      $$ This series is called the binomial series. Notice that if $k$ is a nonnegative integer, then the terms are eventually 0 and so the series is finite. For other values of $k$ none of the terms is 0 and so we can use the Ratio Test to determine radius of convergence $|x|<1$.

      The traditional notation for the coefficients in the binomial series is
      $$
      {k \choose n} =\frac{k(k-1)(k-2) \cdots(k-n+1)}{n !}
      $$ and these numbers are called the binomial coefficients.

      $$ This last form provides a method for determining the first few terms of the product:
      $$
      \begin{aligned}
      f(x) g(x)
      &=\left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n}(x-a)^{n}\right)\left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} b_{n}(x-a)^{n}\right) \\
      &=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_{n} (x-a)^{n}
      \end{aligned}
      $$ where
      $$
      c_n=\sum_{i=0}^{n} a_{i} b_{n-i}
      $$

      Hypotheses:

      - $f(x)=\sum a_{n} (x - a)^{n}$ converges for $|x-a|<R_a.$
      - $g(x)=\sum b_{n} (x - a)^{n}$ converges for $|x-a|<R_b.$
      - The series are multiplied as if they were polynomials:
        $$
        f(x) g(x) =\left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n}(x-a)^{n}\right)\left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} b_{n}(x-a)^{n}\right)
        $$

      Conclusions:

      - $$
        \begin{aligned}
        f(x) g(x)
        &=\left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n}(x-a)^{n}\right)\left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} b_{n}(x-a)^{n}\right) \\
        &=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_{n} (x-a)^{n}
        \end{aligned}
        $$ where
        $$
        c_n=\sum_{i=0}^{n} a_{i} b_{n-i}.
        $$
      - The resulting series converges for $|x-a|<\min(R_a, R_b).$

      division If both $f(x)=\sum c_{n} x^{n}$ and $g(x)=\sum b_{n} x^{n}$ converge for $|x|<R$ and $f$ is divided by $g$ as though they were polynomials, we require $b_{0} \neq 0 $ and use a procedure like long division. The resulting series converges for sufficiently small $|x|.$

      For example:
      <p align="center">
      ![](SVEC-08.07-24.Sy.1.jpg)
      </p>
      <p align="center">
      ![](SVEC-08.07-24.Sy.2.jpg)
      </p>
      Thus $\tan x=x+\frac{1}{3} x^{3}+\frac{2}{15} x^{5}+\cdots$

      Hypotheses:

      - Both $f(x)=\sum c_{n} x^{n}$ and $g(x)=\sum b_{n} x^{n}$ converge for $|x|<R.$
      - The series divided as if they were polynomials using a procedure like long division.
      - $b_{0} \neq 0.$

      Conclusions:

      - For division the resulting series converges for sufficiently small $|x|.$
