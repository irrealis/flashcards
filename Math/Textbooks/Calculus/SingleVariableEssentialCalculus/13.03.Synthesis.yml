      Recall that Part 2 of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus can be written as
      $$
      \int_{a}^{b} F^{\prime}(x) d x=F(b)-F(a)
      $$ where $F^{\prime}$ is continuous on $[a, b] .$ We also called this the Net Change Theorem: The integral of a rate of change is the net change.

      If we think of the gradient vector $\nabla f$ of a function $f$ of two or three variables as a sort of derivative of $f,$ then the following theorem can be regarded as a version of the Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals.

      Let $C$ be a smooth curve given by the vector function $\mathbf{r}(t),$ $a \leqslant t \leqslant b .$ Let $f$ be a differentiable function of two or three variables whose gradient vector $\nabla f$ is continuous on $C$. Then
      $$
      \int_{C} \nabla f \cdot d \mathbf{r}=f(\mathbf{r}(b))-f(\mathbf{r}(a))
      $$ This says that we can evaluate the line integral of a conservative vector field (the gradient vector field of the potential function $f$) simply by knowing the value of $f$ at the endpoints of $C .$ In fact, it says that the line integral of $\nabla f$ is the net change in $f$. If $f$ is a function of two variables and $C$ is a plane curve with initial point $A\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ and terminal point $B\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right),$ as in the following figure, then the theorem becomes
      $$
      \int_{C} \nabla f \cdot d \mathbf{r}=f\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)-f\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)
      $$
      <p align="center">
      ![](SVEC-13.03.02.Sy.1.jpg)
      </p>
      If $f$ is a function of three variables and $C$ is a space curve joining the point $A\left(x_{1}, y_{1}, z_{1}\right)$ to the point $B\left(x_{2}, y_{2}, z_{2}\right),$ then we have
      $$
      \int_{C} \nabla f \cdot d \mathbf{r}=f\left(x_{2}, y_{2}, z_{2}\right)-f\left(x_{1}, y_{1}, z_{1}\right)
      $$

      Hypotheses:

      - Vector function $C = \mathbf{r}(t),$ $a \leqslant t \leqslant b ,$ is a smooth curve.
      - $f$ is differentiable on $C.$
      - $\nabla f$ is continuous on $C$.

      The Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals is also true for piecewise-smooth curves.

      In general, if $\mathbf{F}$ is a continuous vector field with domain $D,$ we say that the line integral $\int_{C} \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{r}$ is **independent of path** if $\int_{C_{1}} \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{r}=\int_{C_{2}} \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{r}$ for any two paths $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ in $D$ that have the same initial and terminal points.

      Hypotheses:

      - $\mathbf{F}$ is a continuous vector field on $D.$
      - $\int_{C_{1}} \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{r}=\int_{C_{2}} \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{r}$ for any two paths $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ in $D$ that have the same initial and terminal points.

      Suppose $\mathbf{F}$ is a vector field that is continuous on an open connected region $D$. If $\int_{C} \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{r}$ is independent of path in $D,$ then $\mathbf{F}$ is a conservative vector field on $D ;$ that is, there exists a function $f$ such that $\nabla f=\mathbf{F}.$

      This says that the only vector fields that are independent of path are conservative. It is stated and proved for plane curves, but there is a similar version for space curves.

      Hypotheses:

      - $D$ is an open region.
      - $\mathbf{F}$ is a continuous vector field on $D$.
      - $\int_{C} \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{r}$ is independent of path in $D.$
