      The **positive orientation** of a simple closed curve $C$ refers to a _single counterclockwise traversal_ of $C .$ Thus if $C$ is given by the vector function $\mathbf{r}(t), a \leqslant t \leqslant b,$ then the region $D$ is always on the left as the point $\mathbf{r}(t)$ traverses $C.$ (See figure below.)

      Hypotheses:

      - $C$ is traversed once.
      - $C$ is traversed counterclockwise.

      Let $C$ be a positively oriented, piecewise-smooth, simple closed curve in the plane and let $D$ be the region bounded by $C .$ If $P$ and $Q$ have continuous partial derivatives on an open region that contains $D$, then
      $$
      \int_{C} P d x+Q d y=\iint_{D}\left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right) d A
      $$

      Recall that the left side of this equation is another way of writing $\int_{C} \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{r}$ where $\mathbf{F}=P \mathbf{i}+Q \mathbf{j}.$

      The notation
      $$
      \oint_{C} P d x+Q d y
      $$ is sometimes used to indicate that the line integral is calculated using the positive orientation of the closed curve $C .$ Another notation for the positively oriented boundary curve of $D$ is $\partial D,$ so the equation in Green's Theorem can be written as
      $$
      \iint_{D}\left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right) d A=\int_{\partial D} P d x+Q d y
      $$

      Hypotheses:

      - $C$ is a positively oriented, piecewise-smooth, simple closed curve in the plane.
      - $D$ is the region bounded by $C.$
      - $P$ and $Q$ have continuous partial derivatives on an open region that contains $D.$

    Back: |
      Green's Theorem should be regarded as the counterpart of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for double integrals. Compare the statement of Green's Theorem, below,
      $$
      \iint_{D}\left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right) d A=\int_{\partial D} P d x+Q d y
      $$ with the statement of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2, in the following equation:
      $$
      \int_{a}^{b} F^{\prime}(x) d x=F(b)-F(a)
      $$ In both cases there is an integral involving derivatives ($F^{\prime},$ $\partial Q / \partial x,$ and $\partial P / \partial y$) on the left side of the equation. And in both cases the right side involves the values of the original functions ($F,$ $Q,$ and $P$) only on the boundary of the domain. (In the one-dimensional case, the domain is an interval $[a, b]$ whose boundary consists of just two points, $a$ and $b.$)

      A **simple region** is a region of both type I and type II. This means it can be expressed as
      $$
      D = \{(x, y) \,|\, g_1(x) \leqslant y \leqslant g_2(x), h_1(y) \leqslant x \leqslant h_2(y)\}
      $$ where $g_1,$ $g_2,$ $h_1,$ and $h_2$ are continuous.

      Hypotheses:
      $$
      D = \{(x, y) \,|\, g_1(x) \leqslant y \leqslant g_2(x), h_1(y) \leqslant x \leqslant h_2(y)\}
      $$ where $g_1,$ $g_2,$ $h_1,$ and $h_2$ are continuous.

      State the _unnamed_ **procedure to compute area using Green's Theorem**. List its hypotheses.
    Back: |
      The reverse direction of Green's Theorem can be used in computing areas. since the area of $D$ is $\iint_{D} 1 d A,$ we wish to choose $P$ and $Q$ so that
      $$
      \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}=1
      $$ There are several possibilities:
      $$
      \begin{array}{lll}
      P(x, y)=0 & P(x, y)=-y & P(x, y)=-\frac{1}{2} y \\
      Q(x, y)=x & Q(x, y)=0 & Q(x, y)=\frac{1}{2} x
      \end{array}
      $$ Then Green's Theorem gives the following formulas for the area of $D:$
      $$
      A=\oint_{C} x d y, \quad A=-\oint_{C} y d x, \quad A=\frac{1}{2} \oint_{C} x d y-y d x
      $$

      Hypotheses:
      $$
      \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}=1
      $$

      Suppose $D$ is the simply-connected finite union of nonoverlapping simple regions shown below.
      <p align="center">
      ![](SVEC-13.04.07.Sy.1.jpg)
      </p>
      We can extend Green's Theorem to this case:
      $$
      \int_{C_{1} \cup C_{2}} P d x+Q d y=\iint_{D}\left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right) d A
      $$ which is Green's Theorem for $D=D_{1} \cup D_{2},$ since its boundary is $C=C_{1} \cup C_{2}.$ The same sort of argument allows us to establish Green's Theorem for any finite union of nonoverlapping simple regions (see figure below).

      State **Green's Theorem extended to regions with holes**. List its hypotheses.
    Back: |
      Green's Theorem can be extended to apply to regions with holes, that is, regions that are not simply-connected. Observe that the boundary $C$ of the region $D$ in the following figure consists of two simple closed curves $C_{1}$ and $C_{2} .$
      <p align="center">
      ![](SVEC-13.04.08.Sy.1.jpg)
      </p>
      We assume that these boundary curves are oriented so that the region $D$ is always on the left as the curve $C$ is traversed. Thus the positive direction is counterclockwise for the outer curve $C_{1}$ but clockwise for the inner curve $C_{2}$. If we divide $D$ into two regions $D^{\prime}$ and $D^{\prime \prime}$ by means of the lines shown in the figure below,
      <p align="center">
      ![](SVEC-13.04.08.Sy.2.jpg)
      </p>
      and then apply Green's Theorem to each of $D^{\prime}$ and $D^{\prime \prime}$ we get
      $$
      \begin{aligned}
      \iint_{D}\left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right) d A &=\iint_{D^{\prime}}\left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right) d A+\iint_{D^{\prime \prime}}\left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right) d A \\
      &=\int_{\partial D^{\prime}} P d x+Q d y+\int_{\partial D^{\prime \prime}} P d x+Q d y
      \end{aligned}
      $$ Since the line integrals along the common boundary lines are in opposite directions, they cancel and we get
      $$
      \iint_{D}\left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right) d A=\int_{C_{1}} P d x+Q d y+\int_{C_{2}} P d x+Q d y=\int_{C} P d x+Q d y
      $$ which is Green's Theorem for the region $D.$
