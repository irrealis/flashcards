      SVEC 01.01 Example 01:
      The graph of a function $f$ is shown below.
      <p align="center">![](SVEC-01.01.Ex-01.1.jpg)</p>
      (a) Find the values of $f(1)$ and $f(5)$.
      (b) What are the domain and range of $f ?$
    Back: |
      (a) We see from the figure that the point $(1,3)$ lies on the graph of $f,$ so the value of $f$ at 1 is $f(1)=3 .$ (In other words, the point on the graph that lies above $x=1$ is 3 units above the $\mathrm{x}$ -axis.) When $x=5,$ the graph lies about 0.7 unit below the $x$ -axis, so we estimate that $f(5) \approx-0.7 .$

      (b) We see that $f(x)$ is defined when $0 \leqslant x \leqslant 7$, so the domain of $f$ is the closed interval $[0,7]$. Notice that $f$ takes on all values from $-2$ to $4,$ so the range of $f$ is

      SVEC 01.01 Example 02:
      ##### representations of a function
      When you turn on a hot-water faucet, the temperature $T$ of the water depends on how long the water has been running. Draw a rough graph of $T$ as a function of the time $t$ that has elapsed since the faucet was turned on.
    Back: |
      The initial temperature of the running water is close to room tempera- ture because the water has been sitting in the pipes. When the water from the hot- water tank starts flowing from the faucet, $T$ increases quickly. In the next phase, $T$ is constant at the temperature of the heated water in the tank. When the tank is drained, $T$ decreases to the temperature of the water supply. This enables us to make the rough sketch of $T$ as a function of $t$ as below.

      SVEC 01.01 Example 03:
      ##### representations of a function
      Find the domain of each function.
      (a) $f(x)=\sqrt{x+2}$
      (b) $g(x)=\frac{1}{x^{2}-x}$
    Back: |
      (a) Because the square root of a negative number is not defined (as a real number), the domain of $f$ consists of all values of $x$ such that $x+2 \geqslant 0 .$ This is equivalent to $x \geqslant-2,$ so the domain is the interval $[-2, \infty) .$

      (b) Since
      $$$$g(x)=\frac{1}{x^{2}-x}=\frac{1}{x(x-1)}$$$$
      and division by 0 is not allowed, we see that $g(x)$ is not defined when $x=0$ or $x=1 .$ Thus the domain of $g$ is $\{x | x \neq 0, x \neq 1\},$ which could also be written in interval notation as $(-\infty, 0) \cup(0,1) \cup(1, \infty).$

      SVEC 01.01 Example 04:
      ##### piecewise defined functions
      A function $f$ is defined by
      $$$$
      f(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}{1-x} & {\text { if } x \leqslant 1} \\ {x^{2}} & {\text { if } x>1}\end{array}\right.
      $$$$
      Evaluate $f(0), f(1),$ and $f(2)$ and sketch the graph.
    Back: |
      Remember that a function is a rule. For this particular function the rule is the following: First look at the value of the input $x$. If it happens that $x \leqslant 1,$ then the value of $f(x)$ is $1-x .$ On the other hand, if $x>1$, then the value of $f(x)$ is $x^{2}$.

      Since $0 \leqslant 1,$ we have $f(0)=1-0=1.$
      Since $1 \leqslant 1,$ we have $f(1)=1-1=0.$
      Since $2>1,$ we have $f(2)=2^{2}=4.$

      How do we draw the graph of $f ?$ We observe that if $x \leqslant 1,$ then $f(x)=1-x$ so the part of the graph of $f$ that lies to the left of the vertical line $x=1$ must coincide with the line $y=1-x,$ which has slope $-1$ and $y$ -intercept $1 .$ If $x>1,$ then $f(x)=x^{2},$ so the part of the graph of $f$ that lies to the right of the line $x=1$ must coincide with the graph of $y=x^{2},$ which is a parabola. This enables us to sketch the graph below.
      <p align="center">![](SVEC-01.01.Ex-04.1.jpg)</p>
      The solid dot indicates that the point $(1,0)$ is included on the graph; the open dot indicates that the point $(1,1)$ is excluded from the graph.

      SVEC 01.01 Example 05:
      ##### piecewise defined functions
      Sketch the graph of the absolute value function $f(x)=|x|.$
    Back: |
      We know that
      $$$$
      |x|=
      \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
          {x} & {\text { if } x \geqslant 0} \\
          {-x} & {\text { if } x < 0}
        \end{array}
      \right.
      $$$$
      The graph of $f$ coincides with the line $y=x$ to the right of the $y$ axis and coincides with the line $y=-x$ to the left of the $y$ axis (see below).

      SVEC 01.01 Example 07:
      ##### symmetry
      Determine whether each of the following functions is even, odd, or neither even nor odd.
      (a) $f(x)=x^{5}+x$
      (b) $g(x)=1-x^{4}$
      (c) $h(x)=2 x-x^{2}$
    Back: |
      (a)
      $$$$\begin{aligned} f(-x) &=(-x)^{5}+(-x)=(-1)^{5} x^{5}+(-x) \\ &=-x^{5}-x=-\left(x^{5}+x\right) \\ &=-f(x) \end{aligned}$$$$
      Therefore $f$ is an odd function.
      <p align="center">![](SVEC-01.01.Ex-07.1.jpg)</p>
      (b)
      $$$$g(-x)=1-(-x)^{4}=1-x^{4}=g(x)$$$$
      So $g$ is even.
      <p align="center">![](SVEC-01.01.Ex-07.2.jpg)</p>
      (c)
      $$$$h(-x)=2(-x)-(-x)^{2}=-2 x-x^{2}$$$$
      Since $h(-x) \neq h(x)$ and $h(-x) \neq-h(x),$ we conclude that $h$ is neither even nor odd.
