      #### Partial Derivatives

      Define **limit of function of two variables**. What are some of its alternate notations?
    Back: |
      Let $f$ be a function of two variables whose domain $D$ includes points arbitrarily close to $(a, b) .$ Then we say that the **limit of $f(x, y)$ as $(x, y)$ approaches $(a, b)$** is $L$ and we write
      $$
      \lim _{(x, y) \rightarrow(a, b)} f(x, y)=L
      $$ if for every number $\varepsilon>0$ there is a corresponding number $\delta>0$ such that
      if $(x, y) \in D$ and $0<\sqrt{(x-a)^{2}+(y-b)^{2}}<\delta$ then $|f(x, y)-L|<\varepsilon.$

      Other notations for the limit in Definition 1 are
      $$
      \lim _{x \rightarrow a \atop y \rightarrow b} f(x, y)=L \quad \text { and } \quad f(x, y) \rightarrow L \text { as }(x, y) \rightarrow(a, b)
      $$

      State the _unnamed_ **multipath test for limit nonexistence**. List its hypotheses.
    Back: |
      If $f(x, y) \rightarrow L_{1}$ as $(x, y) \rightarrow(a, b)$ along a path $C_{1}$ and $f(x, y) \rightarrow L_{2}$ as $(x, y) \rightarrow(a, b)$ along a path $C_{2},$ where $L_{1} \neq L_{2},$ then $\lim _{(x, y) \rightarrow(a, b)} f(x, y)$ does not exist.

      Hypotheses:

      - $f(x,y)$ approaches different limits as $(x,y) \rightarrow (a,b)$ along different paths.

      The **Limit Laws** (sum, difference, constant multiple, constant, product, quotient) hold for functions of two variables, and the following equations are also true:
      $$
      \lim _{(x, y) \rightarrow(a, b)} x=a \quad \lim _{(x, y) \rightarrow(a, b)} y=b \quad \lim _{(x, y) \rightarrow(a, b)} c=c

      State the **Squeeze Theorem**. List its hypotheses.
    Back: |
      The **Squeeze Theorem** holds for functions of two variables:

      If $f(x,y) \leqslant g(x,y) \leqslant h(x,y)$ when $(x,y)$ is near $(a,b)$ (except possibly at $(a,b)$) and
      $$
      \lim _{(x,y) \rightarrow (a,b)} f(x,y)=\lim _{(x,y) \rightarrow (a,b)} h(x,y)=L
      $$ then
      $$
      \lim _{(x,y) \rightarrow (a,b)} g(x,y)=L.
      $$
      Hypotheses:

      - $f(x,y) \leqslant g(x,y) \leqslant h(x,y)$ when $(x,y)$ is near $(a,b)$ (except possibly at $(a,b)$).

      A function $f$ of two variables is called **continuous at $(a, b)$** if
      $$
      \lim _{(x, y) \rightarrow(a, b)} f(x, y)=f(a, b)
      $$ We say $f$ is **continuous on $D$** if $f$ is continuous at every point $(a, b)$ in $D.$

    Back: |
      The **Continuity Laws** (sum, difference, constant multiple, constant, product, quotient) hold for functions of two variables. Consequently, as usual polynomial and rational functions of two variables are continuous on $\mathbb{R}^2.$ Compositions also retain continuity.

      ###### Functions of Three or More Variables
      Define **limit of function of three or more variables**.
    Back: |
      The notation
      $$
      \lim_{\mathbf{v} \rightarrow \mathbf{a}} f(\mathbf{v}) = L
      $$ means that the values of $f(\mathbf{v})$ approach then number $L$ as the point $\mathbf{v}$ approaches the point $\mathbf{a}$ along any path in the domain of $f$.

      More precisely, for every number $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a corresponding number $\delta > 0$ such that if $\mathbf{v}$ is in the domain of $f$ and $|\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{a}| < \delta$ then $|f(\mathbf{v}) - L| < \varepsilon.$

      The Limit Laws extend to functions of three or more variables as they do for functions of two variables.
