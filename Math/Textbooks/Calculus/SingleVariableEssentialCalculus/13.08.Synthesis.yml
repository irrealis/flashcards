      Define **positive orientation of boundary curve**. List its hypotheses.
    Back: |
      The orientation of a bounded surface $S$ induces the **positive orientation of the boundary curve $C$** shown in the figure below.

      </p>
      This means that if you walk in the positive direction around $C$ with your head pointing in the direction of $\mathbf{n}$, then the surface will always be on your left.

      Hypotheses:

      - $S$ is bounded.
      - $S$ is oriented.

      To do: verify hypotheses.

      State **Stokes' Theorem**. List its hypotheses.
    Back: |
      Let $S$ be an oriented piecewise-smooth surface that is bounded by a simple, closed, piecewise-smooth boundary curve $C$ with posi tive orientation. Let $\mathbf{F}$ be a vector field whose components have continuous partial derivatives on an open region in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ that contains $S$. Then
      $$
      \int_{C} \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{r}=\iint_{S} \operatorname{curl} \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{S}
      $$

      This relates a surface integral over a surface $S$ to a line integral around the boundary curve of $S$ (which is a space curve) and says that the line integral around the boundary curve of $S$ of the tangential component of $\mathbf{F}$ is equal to the surface integral of the normal component of the curl of $\mathbf{F}.$

      Hypotheses:

      - $C$ is an oriented closed curve.
      - The components of $\mathbf{v}$ have continuous partial derivatives on an open region that contains $C.$

      State the _unnamed_ **relationship between different surfaces with same boundary curve**. List its hypotheses.
    Back: |
      In general, if $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ are oriented surfaces with the same oriented boundary curve $C$ and both satisfy the hypotheses of Stokes' Theorem, then
      $$
      \iint_{S_{1}} \operatorname{curl} \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{S}=\int_{C} \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{r}=\iint_{S_{2}} \operatorname{curl} \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{S}
      $$ This fact is useful when it is difficult to integrate over one surface but easy to integrate over the other.

      Hypotheses:

      - $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ are oriented surfaces that both satisfy the hypotheses of Stokes' Theorem.
      - $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ have the same oriented boundary curve $C.$

      Suppose that $C$ is an oriented closed curve and $\mathbf{v}$ represents the velocity field in a fluid flow. Consider the line integral
      $$
      \int_{C} \mathbf{v} \cdot d \mathbf{r}=\int_{C} \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{T} d s.
      $$ This measures the tendency of the fluid to move around $C$ and is called the **circulation** of $\mathbf{v}$ around $C.$ (See figure below.)

      Hypotheses:

      - $S$ is a bounded, oriented, piecewise-smooth surface.
      - The components of $\mathbf{v}$ have continuous partial derivatives on an open region that contains $S.$

      ###### Stokes' Theorem
      State the _unnamed_ **expression of fluid rotation**. List its hypotheses.
    Back: |
      Suppose that $\mathbf{v}$ represents the velocity field in a fluid flow. Let $P_{0}\left(x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0}\right)$ be a point in the fluid and let $S_{a}$ be a small disk with radius $a$ and center $P_{0} .$ Then $(\operatorname{curl} \mathbf{v})(P) \approx(\operatorname{curl} \mathbf{v})\left(P_{0}\right)$ for all points $P$ on $S_{a}$ because curl $\mathbf{v}$ is continuous. Thus, by Stokes' Theorem, we get the following approximation to the circulation around the boundary circle $C_{a}$
      $$
      \begin{aligned}
      \int_{C_{a}} \mathbf{v} \cdot d \mathbf{r}
      &=\iint_{S_{a}} \operatorname{curl} \mathbf{v} \cdot d \mathbf{S}=\iint_{S_{a}} \operatorname{curl} \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{n} d S \\
      & \approx \iint_{S_{a}} \operatorname{curl} \mathbf{v}\left(P_{0}\right) \cdot \mathbf{n}\left(P_{0}\right) d S=\operatorname{curl} \mathbf{v}\left(P_{0}\right) \cdot \mathbf{n}\left(P_{0}\right) \pi a^{2}
      \end{aligned}
      $$ This approximation becomes better as $a \rightarrow 0$ and we have
      $$
      \operatorname{curl} \mathbf{v}\left(P_{0}\right) \cdot \mathbf{n}\left(P_{0}\right)=\lim _{a \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{\pi a^{2}} \int_{C_{a}} \mathbf{v} \cdot d \mathbf{r}
      $$ which gives the relationship between the curl and the circulation. It shows that $\operatorname{curl}\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{n}$ is a measure of the rotating effect of the fluid about the axis $\mathbf{n}.$ The curling effect is greatest about the axis parallel to $\operatorname{curl}\mathbf{v}.$

      Hypotheses:

      - The components of $\mathbf{v}$ have continuous partial derivatives on an open region that contains $P_0 .$
