      If $\mathbf{F}=P \mathbf{i}+Q \mathbf{j}+R \mathbf{k}$ is a vector field on $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and the partial derivatives of $P, Q,$ and $R$ all exist, then the curl of $\mathbf{F}$ is the vector field on $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ defined by
      $$
      \operatorname{curl} \mathbf{F}=\left(\frac{\partial R}{\partial y}-\frac{\partial Q}{\partial z}\right) \mathbf{i}+\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial z}-\frac{\partial R}{\partial x}\right) \mathbf{j}+\left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right) \mathbf{k}
      $$

      Hypotheses:

      - $\mathbf{F}=P \mathbf{i}+Q \mathbf{j}+R \mathbf{k}$ is a vector field on $\mathbb{R}^{3}.$
      - The partial derivatives of $P, Q,$ and $R$ all exist.

      The easiest way to remember the definition of curl is by means of the symbolic expression
      $$
      \operatorname{curl} \mathbf{F}=\nabla \times \mathbf{F}
      $$ where $\nabla$ (a.k.a. "del") is expressed
      $$
      \nabla=\mathbf{i} \frac{\partial}{\partial x}+\mathbf{j} \frac{\partial}{\partial y}+\mathbf{k} \frac{\partial}{\partial z}
      $$ and the symbolic cross-product resolves as
      $$
      \begin{aligned}
      \nabla \times \mathbf{F} &=\left|\begin{array}{ccc}
      \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
      \frac{\partial}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \\
      P & Q & R
      \end{array}\right|=\left(\frac{\partial R}{\partial y}-\frac{\partial Q}{\partial z}\right) \mathbf{i}+\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial z}-\frac{\partial R}{\partial x}\right) \mathbf{j}+\left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right) \mathbf{k} \\
      &=\operatorname{curl} \mathbf{F}
      \end{aligned}

      If $f$ is a scalar function of three variables that has continuous second-order partial derivatives, then
      $$
      \operatorname{curl}(\nabla f)=\mathbf{0}
      $$ In other words, the curl of a gradient vector field is $\mathbf{0}.$ Recall that the gradient of a scalar-valued function $f$ of three variables is a vector field on $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and so we can compute its curl.

      Hypotheses:

      - $f$ is a scalar function of three variables.
      - $f$ has continuous second-order partial derivatives.

      If $\mathbf{F}$ is conservative, then $\operatorname{curl} \mathbf{F}=\mathbf{0}.$

      This is just a restatement of the theorem that if a scalar function $f$ of three variables has continuous second-order partial derivatives, then
      $$
      \operatorname{curl}(\nabla f)=\mathbf{0}
      $$ since a conservative vector field is one for which $\mathbf{F}=\nabla f$ for some function $f.$


      Hypotheses:

      - $\mathbf{F}$ is conservative.

      **Questions:**

      - Are there circumstances under which $\mathbf{F}$ is considered conservative on a restricted domain? (I think allowing this leads to failure of this unnamed theorem.)
        - **Reason for question:** Consider $\nabla |x|,$ which isn't defined when $x=0.$ But if we define the vector field $$
        \mathbf{F} = 
        \begin{cases}
          \left\langle -1,0,0 \right\rangle & \text{if $x<0$} \\
          \left\langle +1,0,0 \right\rangle & \text{if $x \geqslant 0$}
        \end{cases}
        $$ then $\mathbf{F}$ is well defined, its curl is zero everywhere, and it equals $\nabla |x|$ except when $x=0.$ I think this exception implies $\mathbf{F}$ is not conservative, unless there are circumstances under which $\mathbf{F}$ is considered conservative on a restricted domain? But if we allow this then I think it would break certain theorems.
        - **Probable answer:** I think this example implies that "conservative" has to apply to an entire vector space.

      If $\mathbf{F}$ is a vector field defined on all of $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ whose component functions have continuous partial derivatives and $\operatorname{curl}\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{0},$ then $\mathbf{F}$ is a conservative vector field.

      If $\mathbf{F}$ is conservative, then $\operatorname{curl} \mathbf{F}=\mathbf{0}.$

      Thus the converse of "if $\mathbf{F}$ is conservative, then $\operatorname{curl} \mathbf{F}=\mathbf{0}$" is not true in general (see questions related to that theorem on note _SVEC-13.05.06 Synthesis_), but it _is_ true if $\mathbf{F}$ has continuous partials defined everywhere. (More generally it is true if the domain is simply-connected, that is, "has no hole.")

      (This theorem is the three-dimensional version of theorem SVEC-13.03 6. Its proof requires Stokes' Theorem and is sketched at the end of SVEC-13.08.)

      Hypotheses:

      - $\mathbf{F}$ is a vector field defined on $\mathbb{R}^{3}.$
      - $\mathbf{F}$ has continuous partial derivatives on $\mathbb{R}^{3}.$
      - $\operatorname{curl}\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{0}.$

      State the **physical interpretation of curl** and define **irrotational**.
    Back: |
      The reason for the name _curl_ is that the curl vector is associated with rotations. This occurs, for example, when $\mathbf{F}$ represents the velocity field in fluid flow. Particles near $(x, y, z)$ in the fluid tend to rotate about the axis that points in the direction of curl $\mathbf{F}(x, y, z)$ and the length of this curl vector is a measure of how quickly the particles move around the axis of this curl vector (see below).

      ![](SVEC-13.05.07.Sy.1.jpg)
      </p>
      If $\operatorname{curl} \mathbf{F}=\mathbf{0}$ at a point $P,$ then the fluid is free from rotations at $P$ and $\mathbf{F}$ is called **irrotational** at $P .$ In other words, there is no whirlpool or eddy at $P .$ If $\operatorname{curl} \mathbf{F}=\mathbf{0},$ then a tiny paddle wheel moves with the fluid but doesn't rotate about its axis. If curl $\mathbf{F} \neq \mathbf{0},$ the paddle wheel rotates about its axis.

      In terms of the gradient operator $\nabla=(\partial / \partial x) \mathbf{i}+(\partial / \partial y) \mathbf{j}+(\partial / \partial z) \mathbf{k},$ the divergence of $\mathbf{F}$ can be written symbolically as the dot product of $\nabla$ and $\mathbf{F}:$

    Back: |
      The reason for the name _divergence_ can be understood in the context of fluid flow. If $\mathbf{F}(x, y, z)$ is the velocity of a fluid (or gas), then $\operatorname{div} \mathbf{F}(x, y, z)$ represents the net rate of change (with respect to time) of the mass of fluid (or gas) flowing from the point $(x, y, z)$ per unit volume. In other words, $\operatorname{div} \mathbf{F}(x, y, z)$ measures the tendency of the fluid to diverge from the point $(x, y, z) .$ If $\operatorname{div} \mathbf{F}=0,$ then $\mathbf{F}$ is said to be **incompressible**.

      If $f$ is a function of three variables, we have

      $$ and this expression occurs so often that we abbreviate it as $\nabla^{2} f .$ The operator
      $$
      \nabla^{2}=\nabla \cdot \nabla
      $$ is called the **Laplace operator** because of its relation to **Laplace's equation**
      $$
      \nabla^{2} f=\frac{\partial^{2} f}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2} f}{\partial y^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2} f}{\partial z^{2}}=0
      $$ We can also apply the Laplace operator $\nabla^{2}$ to a vector field
      $$
      \mathbf{F}=P \mathbf{i}+Q \mathbf{j}+R \mathbf{k}
      $$ in terms of its components:
      $$
      \nabla^{2} \mathbf{F}=\nabla^{2} P \mathbf{i}+\nabla^{2} Q \mathbf{j}+\nabla^{2} R \mathbf{k}

If $\mathbf{F}=P \mathbf{i}+Q \mathbf{j}$ is a vector field on $\mathbb{R}^2$ then, regarding $\mathbf{F}$ as a vector field on $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with third component $0,$ we can rewrite the equation in Green's Theorem in the vector form
