      ##### steps in solving optimization problems
      List the basic steps in solving optimization problems.
    Back: |
      1. Draw a diagram.
      2. Assign variables to unknown quantities.
      3. Maximize or minimize which quantity?
      4. Find a function $f$ of one variable that represents the quantity to be optimized. Perform a substitution if there is more than one variable.
      5. Find the absolute maximum or minimum value of $f$ on the given domain.

      ##### first derivative test for absolute extreme values
      State the **First Derivative Test for Absolute Extreme Values.**
    Back: |
      Suppose that $c$ is a critical number of a continuous function $f$ defined on an interval.
      (a) If $f^{\prime}(x)>0$ for all $x<c$ and $f^{\prime}(x)<0$ for all $x>c$, then $f(c)$ is the absolute maximum value of $f$.
      (b) If $f^{\prime}(x)<0$ for all $x<c$ and $f^{\prime}(x)>0$ for all $x>c,$ then $f(c)$ is the absolute minimum value of $f$.

      What is a **marginal cost?**
    Back: |
      If $C(x),$ the **cost function,** is the cost of producing $x$ units of a certain product, then the **marginal cost** is the rate of change of $C$ with respect to $x .$ In other words, the marginal cost function is the derivative, $C^{\prime}(x),$ of the cost function.

      What is a **demand function** or **price function?**
    Back: |
      In marketing, let $p(x)$ be the price per unit that the company can charge if it sells $x$ units. Then $p$ is called the **demand function** (or **price function**) and we would expect it to be a decreasing function of $x .$

      Let $p(x)$ be the price per unit that the company can charge if it sells $x$ units. Then $p$ is called the **demand function** (or **price function**) and we would expect it to be a decreasing function of $x .$ If $x$ units are sold and the price per unit is $p(x),$ then the total revenue is
      $$$
      R(x)=x p(x)
      $$$ and $R$ is called the **revenue function**.

      What is a **profit function?**
    Back: |
      Let $p(x)$ be the price per unit that the company can charge if it sells $x$ units. Then $p$ is called the **demand function** (or **price function**) and we would expect it to be a decreasing function of $x .$ If $x$ units are sold and the price per unit is $p(x),$ then the total revenue is
      $$$

      $$$ and $R$ is called the **revenue function**. The derivative $R^{\prime}$ of the revenue function is called the **marginal revenue function** and is the rate of change of revenue with respect to the number of units sold.

      If $x$ units are sold, then the total profit is
      $$$
      P(x)=R(x)-C(x)
      $$$ and $P$ is called the **profit function.**
