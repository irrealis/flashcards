      #### Partial Derivatives

      Define **local/absolute minima/maxima**, **local/absolute minimum/maximum value**, **extrema**.
    Back: |
      A function of two variables has a **local maximum** at $(a, b)$ if $f(x, y) \leqslant f(a, b)$ when $(x, y)$ is near $(a, b) .$ The number $f(a, b)$ is called a **local maximum value**.

      If $f(x, y) \geqslant f(a, b)$ when $(x, y)$ is near $(a, b),$ then $f$ has a **local minimum** at $(a, b)$ and $f(a, b)$ is a **local minimum value**.

      If these inequalities hold for _all_ points $(x, y)$ in the domain of $f,$ then $f$ has an **absolute maximum** (or **absolute minimum**) at $(a, b),$ and corresponding **absolute minimum/maximum values**.

      The **extrema** of $f$ are its **local and absolute minima and maxima**. The **extreme values** of $f$ are its **local and absolute minimum and maximum values**.

      #### Partial Derivatives
      ##### Maximum and Minimum Values
      State the _unnamed_ **values of partials at local extrema** and their geometric interpretation. List their hypotheses.
    Back: |
      If $f$ has a local maximum or minimum at $(a, b)$ and the first-order partial derivatives of $f$ exist there, then $f_{x}(a, b)=0$ and $f_{y}(a, b)=0.$

      This conclusion can be stated in the notation of gradient vectors as $\nabla f(a, b)=\mathbf{0}.$

      Hypotheses:

      - $f$ has a local maximum or minimum at $(a, b).$
      - The first-order partial derivatives of $f$ exist at $(a, b).$

      If we put $f_{x}(a, b)=0$ and $f_{y}(a, b)=0$ in the equation of a tangent plane, we get $z=z_{0} .$ Thus the geometric interpretation of this theorem is that if the graph of $f$ has a tangent plane at a local maximum or minimum, then the tangent plane must be horizontal.

      Hypotheses:

      - $f$ has a local maximum or minimum at $(a, b).$
      - The graph of $f$ has a tangent plane at $(a, b).$

    Back: |
      A point $(a, b)$ is called a **critical point** (or **stationary point**) of $f$ if $f_{x}(a, b)=0$ and $f_{y}(a, b)=0,$ or if one of these partial derivatives does not exist.

      Hypotheses:

      - $f_{x}(a, b)=0$ and $f_{y}(a, b)=0,$ or one of these partial derivatives does not exist.

    Back: |
      A **saddle point** or **minimax point** of $f(x,y)$ is a point $(a,b)$ at which $f_{x}(a, b)=0$ and $f_{y}(a, b)=0$, but $(a,b)$ not a local extremum of $f.$

      Hypotheses:

      - $f_{x}(a, b)=0$ and $f_{y}(a, b)=0$. 
      - $(a,b)$ not a local extremum of $f.$

      State the **Second Derivatives Test**. List its hypotheses.
    Back: |
      Suppose the second partial derivatives of $f$ are continuous on a disk with center $(a, b),$ and suppose that $f_{x}(a, b)=0$ and $f_{y}(a, b)=0$ [that is, $(a, b)$ is a critical point of $f$]. Let
      $$
      D=D(a, b)=f_{x x}(a, b) f_{y y}(a, b)-\left[f_{x y}(a, b)\right]^{2}
      $$
      1. If $D>0$ and $f_{x x}(a, b)>0,$ then $f(a, b)$ is a local minimum.
      2. If $D>0$ and $f_{x x}(a, b)<0,$ then $f(a, b)$ is a local maximum.
      3. If $D=0,$ the test gives no information: $f$ could have a local maximum or local minimum at $(a, b),$ or $(a, b)$ could be a saddle point of $f.$
      4. If $D<0$, then $f(a, b)$ is a saddle point.

      Hypotheses:

      - The second partial derivatives of $f$ are continuous on a disk with center $(a, b).$
      - $f_{x}(a, b)=0$ and $f_{y}(a, b)=0.$

      Notes:

      - To remember the formula for $D$, it's helpful to write it as a determinant
        $$
        D=\left|\begin{array}{ll}
        f_{x x} & f_{x y} \\
        f_{y x} & f_{y y}
        \end{array}\right|=f_{x x} f_{y y}-\left(f_{x y}\right)^{2}
        $$

      Define **closed set**.
    Back: |
      A closed set in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is one that contains all its boundary points.

      For instance, the disk
      $$
      D=\left\{(x, y) | x^{2}+y^{2} \leq 1\right\}
      $$ which consists of all points on or inside the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}=1,$ is a closed set because it contains all of its boundary points (which are the points on the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}=1$ ). But if even one point on the boundary curve were omitted, the set would not be closed. (See figures below.)
