      ##### net change theorem
      If an object moves along a straight line with position function $s(t)$ then, in terms of the Net Change Theorem, state the distance traveled by the particle during the time period from $t_{1}$ to $t_{2} .$
    Back: |
      If we want to calculate the distance traveled during the time interval, we have to consider the intervals when $v(t) \geqslant 0$ (the particle moves to the right) and also the intervals when $v(t) \leqslant 0$ (the particle moves to the left). In both cases the distance is computed by integrating $|v(t)|,$ the speed.
      $$$
      \int_{t_{1}}^{t_{h}}|v(t)| d t=\text { total distance traveled }
      $$$ The figure below shows how both displacement and distance traveled can be interpreted in terms of areas under a velocity curve.
      <p align="center">![](SVEC-04.03.Th-17.1.jpg)</p>
      displacement $=\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} v(t) d t=A_{1}-A_{2}+A_{3}$
      distance $=\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}|v(t)| d t=A_{1}+A_{2}+A_{3}$

      edge case. I''ll just have to get used to it during problem sets.</div>'

      If an object moves along a straight line with position function $s(t)$ then, in terms of the Net Change Theorem, state the change in velocity of the particle during the time period from $t_{1}$ to $t_{2} .$
    Back: |
      The acceleration of the object is $a(t)=v^{\prime}(t),$ so
      $$$
      \int_{t_{1}}^{t_{0}} a(t) d t=v\left(t_{2}\right)-v\left(t_{1}\right)
      $$$ is the change in velocity from time $t_{1}$ to time $t_{2}$.
