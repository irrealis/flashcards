      If $f$ is a function of two variables $x$ and $y,$ then the **gradient of $f$** is the vector function $\nabla f$ defined by
      $$
      \nabla f(x, y)=\left\langle f_{x}(x, y), f_{y}(x, y)\right\rangle=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \mathbf{i}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \mathbf{j}

      If we use vector notation, then we can write the directional derivative in the compact form
      $$

      $$ This is reasonable because the vector equation of the line through $\mathbf{x}_{0}$ in the direction of the vector $\mathbf{u}$ is given by $\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{x}_{0}+t \mathbf{u}$ and so $f\left(\mathbf{x}_{0}+h \mathbf{u}\right)$ represents the value of $f$ at a point on this line.

      Hypotheses:

      - $\mathbf{u}$ is a unit vector.

      Let $\mathbf{x}_0$ be in the domain of real-valued $f(\mathbf{x}).$
      1. The gradient vector $\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_0)$ gives the direction of fastest increase of $f.$
      2. $\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_0)$ is orthogonal to level surface $S$ of $f$ through $\mathbf{x}_0.$

      These two properties are quite compatible intuitively because as we move away from $\mathbf{x}_0$ on the level surface $S,$ the value of $f$ does not change at all. So it seems reasonable that if we move in the perpendicular direction, we get the maximum increase.

      In the figure below we visualize a function $f$ of two variables and a point $P\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\right)$ in its domain.
      <p align="center">
      ![](SVEC-11.06.17.Sy.1.jpg)

      Note that gradient vector $\nabla f\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\right)$ gives the direction of fastest increase of $f,$ and that $\nabla f\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\right)$ is perpendicular to the level curve $f(x, y)=k$ that passes through $P .$

      If we consider a topographical map of a hill and let $f(x, y)$ represent the height above sea level at a point with coordinates $(x, y),$ then a curve of steepest ascent can be drawn, as in the following figure, by making it perpendicular to all of the contour lines.
      <p align="center">
      ![](SVEC-11.06.17.Sy.2.jpg)
      </p>
      Computer algebra systems have commands that plot sample gradient vectors. Each gradient vector $\nabla f(a, b)$ is plotted starting at the point $(a, b) .$ Figure 13 shows such a plot (called a gradient vector field) for the function $f(x, y)=x^{2}-y^{2}$ superimposed on a contour map of $f .$ As expected, the gradient vectors point "uphill" and are perpendicular to the level curves.
