      State the **vector equation of a line**, and define **direction** and **parameter**.
    Back: |
      The **vector equation of a line** is expressed as
      $$
      \mathbf{r}=\mathbf{r}_{0}+t \mathbf{v}
      $$ where $\mathbf{r}_{0}$ is an arbitrary point on a line $L,$ $\mathbf{v}$ describes the line's **direction**, and the **parameter** $t$ gives the position vector $\mathbf{r}$ of a point on $L.$

      A line $L$ in three-dimensional space is determined when we know a point $P_{0}\left(x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0}\right)$ on $L$ and the direction of $L .$ In three dimensions the direction of a line is conveniently described by a vector, so we let $\mathbf{v}$ be a vector parallel to $L$. Let $P(x, y, z)$ be an arbitrary point on $L$ and let $\mathbf{r}_{0}$ and $\mathbf{r}$ be the position vectors of $P_{0}$ and $P$ (that is, they have representations $\overrightarrow{O P_{0}}$ and $\overrightarrow{O P}$ ). If $\mathbf{a}$ is the vector with representation $\overrightarrow{P_{0} P}$ as shown below, then the Triangle Law for vector addition gives $\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{r}_{0}+$ $\mathbf{a}.$
      <p align="center">
      ![](SVEC-10.05-01.Sy.1.jpg)
      </p>
      But, since $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ are parallel vectors, there is a scalar $t$ such that $\mathbf{a}=t \mathbf{v} .$ Thus
      $$
      \mathbf{r}=\mathbf{r}_{0}+t \mathbf{v}
      $$ which is a vector equation of $L.$

      Observations:

      - The direction vector is not unique. If $\mathbf{u}$ is any scalar multiple of $\mathbf{v}$ then
        $$
        \mathbf{r}=\mathbf{r}_{0}+t \mathbf{u}
        $$ also describes $L.$

      The equations
      $$
      x=x_{0}+a t \quad y=y_{0}+b t \quad z=z_{0}+c t
      $$ are called **parametric equations of the line $L$ through the point $P_{0}\left(x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0}\right)$ and parallel to the vector $\mathbf{v}=\langle a, b, c\rangle.$** Each value of the parameter $t$ gives a point $(x, y, z)$ on $L.$

      Define **direction numbers**.
    Back: |
      In general, if a vector $\mathbf{v}=\langle a, b, c\rangle$ is used to describe the direction of a line $L$ then the numbers $a, b,$ and $c$ are called **direction numbers of $L .$**

      Observations:

      - The direction numbers of $L$ are not unique. Since any vector parallel to $\mathbf{v}$ could also be used, we see that any three numbers proportional to $a, b,$ and $c$ could also be used as a set of direction numbers for $L$
      - If one of $a, b,$ or $c$ is $0,$ then the direction vector $\mathbf{v} = \langle a, b, c \rangle$ coincides with a plane containing two axes. If two are zero then $\mathbf{v}$ coincides with an axis.
      - At least one of $a, b,$ or $c$ must be nonzero; otherwise $v = \mathbf{0}$ and any parametric equation
      $$
      x=x_{0}+a t \quad y=y_{0}+b t \quad z=z_{0}+c t
      $$ describes just the point $(x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0}).$

      Define **symmetric equations**. State the _unnamed_ **symmetric equations** theorem. What are its hypotheses?
    Back: |
      Given a line $L$ with parametric equations
      $$
      x=x_{0}+a t \quad y=y_{0}+b t \quad z=z_{0}+c t,
      $$ if none of $a, b,$ or $c$ is $0,$ we can solve each of these equations for $t,$ equate the results, and obtain
      $$
      \frac{x-x_{0}}{a}=\frac{y-y_{0}}{b}=\frac{z-z_{0}}{c}.
      $$ These equations are called **symmetric equations of $L .$**

      Notice that the numbers $a$ $b,$ and $c$ that appear in the denominators are direction numbers of $L$ that is, components of a vector parallel to $L$. If one of $a, b,$ or $c$ is $0,$ we can still eliminate $t .$ For instance, if $a=0,$ we could write the equations of $L$ as
      $$
      x=x_{0} \quad \frac{y-y_{0}}{b}=\frac{z-z_{0}}{c}
      $$ This means that $L$ lies in the vertical plane $x=x_{0}.$

      Hypotheses:

      - None of $a, b,$ or $c$ is $0.$

      Caveats:

      - If one of $a, b,$ or $c$ is $0,$ we can still eliminate $t .$

      The line segment from $\mathbf{r}_{0}$ to $\mathbf{r}_{1}$ is given by the vector equation
      $$
      \mathbf{r}(t)=(1-t) \mathbf{r}_{0}+t \mathbf{r}_{1} \quad 0 \leqslant t \leqslant 1
      $$

      Hypotheses:

      - $\mathbf{r}_{0} \ne \mathbf{r}_{1};$ otherwise the vector equation is degenerate and describes a point instead of a line segment.

    Back: |
      **skew lines** are sets of lines that do not intersect and are not parallel (and therefore do not lie in the same plane).

      Observations:

      - I'd say the defining characteristic of skew lines is that they are non-coplanar.

      Define **normal vector**.
    Back: |
      A plane in space is determined by a point $P_{0}\left(x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0}\right)$ in the plane and a vector $\mathbf{n}$ that is orthogonal to the plane. This orthogonal vector $\mathbf{n}$ is called a **normal vector**.

      Observations:

      - The idea of a normal vector extends to $n>0$ dimensions. Any vector $\mathbf{v}$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is normal to a plane containing the origin, and any line in this plane is orthogonal to $\mathbf{v}.$
      - In $n$ dimensions, any subspace $U$ of $V$ has a null that can be considered orthogonal to $V^m$. I think the key characteristic of this idea is that subspaces $T$ and $U$ are orthogonal if any vector in $T$ is orthogonal to any vector in $U$.
      - This relates to a question noted in _SVEC-10.03-06 Synthesis_: The idea that $\mathbf{0}$ is perpendicular to itself is excluded from the text's definition, which requires that orthogonal vectors be nonzero. _**Does this exclusion serve any purpose than to discard the degenerate case?**_

      $$
      \mathbf{n} \cdot\left(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_{0}\right)=0

      By collection the terms of the scalar equation of the plane through $P_{0}\left(x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0}\right)$ with normal vector $\mathbf{n}=\langle a, b, c\rangle,$ we rewrite the scalar equation to obtain the **linear equation of the plane**
