      In this context a **transformation** is a function $T$ that maps a subset $A$ of $X$ to another subset $B$ of $X$. (Note: this is not the usual definition of _transformation_.)

      Here we consider a change of variables that is given by a transformation $T$ from the $u v$-plane to the $x y$-plane:
      $$
      T(u, v)=(x, y)
      $$ where $x$ and $y$ are related to $u$ and $v$ by the equations
      $$
      x=g(u, v) \quad y=h(u, v)
      $$ or, as we sometimes write,
      $$
      x=x(u, v) \quad y=y(u, v)
      $$ or, as we sometimes write,
      $$
      x=x(u, v) \quad y=y(u, v)
      $$ We usually assume that $T$ is a **$C^{1}$ transformation**, which means that $g$ and $h$ have continuous first-order partial derivatives.

      If $T\left(u_{1}, v_{1}\right)=\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right),$ then the point $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ is called the **image** of the point $\left(u_{1}, v_{1}\right) .$ If no two points have the same image, $T$ is called **one-to-one**. The following figure shows the effect of a transformation $T$ on a region $S$ in the $u v$-plane. $T$ transforms $S$ into a region $R$ in the $x y$-plane called the **image** of $S,$ consisting of the images of all points in $S$

      </p>
      If $T$ is a one-to-one transformation, then it has an **inverse transformation** $T^{-1}$ from the $x y$-plane to the $u v$-plane and it may be possible to solve $u$ and $v$ in terms of $x$ and $y:$
      $$
      u=G(x, y) \quad v=H(x, y)
      $$

      The Jacobian of the transformation $T$ given by $x=g(u, v)$ and $y=h(u, v)$ is
      $$
      \frac{\partial(x, y)}{\partial(u, v)}=\left|\begin{array}{cc}\frac{\partial x}{\partial u} & \frac{\partial x}{\partial v} \\ \frac{\partial y}{\partial u} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial v}\end{array}\right|=\frac{\partial x}{\partial u} \frac{\partial y}{\partial v}-\frac{\partial x}{\partial v} \frac{\partial y}{\partial u}
      $$

      Hypotheses:

      - $T$ is differentiable.

      State the **Change of Variables in a Double Integral**. List its hypotheses.
    Back: |
      Suppose that $T$ is a $C^{1}$ transformation whose Jacobian is nonzero and that maps a region $S$ in the $u v$-plane onto a region $R$ in the $x y$-plane. Suppose that $f$ is continuous on $R$ and that $R$ and $S$ are type I or type II plane regions. Suppose also that $T$ is one-to-one, except perhaps on the boundary of $S .$ Then
      $$
      \iint_{R} f(x, y) d A=\iint_{S} f(x(u, v), y(u, v))\left|\frac{\partial(x, y)}{\partial(u, v)}\right| d u d v
      $$

      This says that we change from an integral in $x$ and $y$ to an integral in $u$ and $v$ by expressing $x$ and $y$ in terms of $u$ and $v$ and writing
      $$
      d A=\left|\frac{\partial(x, y)}{\partial(u, v)}\right| d u d v
      $$

      Hypotheses:

      - $T$ maps $S$ in the $uv$-plane onto $R$ in the $xy$-plane.
      - $T$ is one-to-one, except perhaps on the boundary of $S.$
      - The Jacobian of $T$ is nonzero.
      - $T$ is a $C^{1}$ transformation.
      - $R$ and $S$ are type I or type II plane regions.
      - $f$ is continuous on $R.$

      Let $T$ be a transformation that maps a region $S$ in $u v w$-space onto a region $R$ in $x y z$-space by means of the equations
      $$
      x=g(u, v, w) \quad y=h(u, v, w) \quad z=k(u, v, w)
      $$ The Jacobian of $T$ is the following $3 \times 3$ determinant:
      $$
      \frac{\partial(x, y, z)}{\partial(u, v, w)}=\left|\begin{array}{lll}
      \frac{\partial x}{\partial u} & \frac{\partial x}{\partial v} & \frac{\partial x}{\partial w} \\
