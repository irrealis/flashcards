      Suppose that $\sum a_{n}$ and $\sum b_{n}$ are series with positive terms.
      (i) If $\sum b_{n}$ is convergent and $a_{n} \leqslant b_{n}$ for all $n,$ then $\sum a_{n}$ is also convergent.
      (ii) If $\sum b_{n}$ is divergent and $a_{n} \geqslant b_{n}$ for all $n,$ then $\sum a_{n}$ is also divergent.

      What are the **Standard Series for Use with the Comparison Test?**
    Back: |
      In using the Comparison Test we must, of course, have some known series $\sum b_{n}$ for the purpose of comparison. Most of the time we use one of these series:
      (i) A $p$-series [$\sum 1 / n^{p}$ converges if $p>1$ and diverges if $p \leqslant 1$]
      (ii) A geometric series [$\sum a r^{n-1}$ converges if $|r|<1$ and diverges if $|r| \geqslant 1$]

      Do we need to verify the Comparison Test for all $n$?
    Back: |
      Although the condition $a_{n} \leqslant b_{n}$ or $a_{n} \geqslant b_{n}$ in the Comparison Test is given for all $n,$ we need verify only that it holds for $n \geqslant N,$ where $N$ is some fixed integer, because the convergence of a series is not affected by a finite number of terms.

      Suppose that $\sum a_{n}$ and $\sum b_{n}$ are series with positive terms. If
      $$
      \lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}=c
      $$ where $c$ is a finite number and $c>0,$ then either both series converge or both diverge.

      ##### estimating sums
      When using a comparison series to estimate the sum of a series, what is meant by **remainder?**
    Back: |
      If we have used the Comparison Test to show that a series $\sum a_{n}$ converges by comparison with a series $\sum b_{n},$ then we may be able to estimate the sum $\sum a_{n}$ by comparing remainders. As in the Remainder Estimate for the Integral Test, we consider the remainder
      $$
      R_{n}=s-s_{n}=a_{n+1}+a_{n+2}+\cdots
      $$ For the comparison series $\sum b_{n}$ we consider the corresponding remainder
      $$
      T_{n}=t-t_{n}=b_{n+1}+b_{n+2}+\cdots
      $$ Since $a_{n} \leqslant b_{n}$ for all $n,$ we have $R_{n} \leqslant T_{n} .$ If $\sum b_{n}$ is a $p$ -series, we can estimate its remain$\operatorname{der} T_{n}$ as in the Remainder Estimate for the Integral Test. If $\sum b_{n}$ is a geometric series, then $T_{n}$ is the sum of a geometric series and we can sum it exactly. In either case we know that $R_{n}$ is smaller than $T_{n}$.
