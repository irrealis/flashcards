      ##### integration by parts
      Give the **formula for integration by parts** in terms of differentials.
    Back: |
      Let $u=f(x)$ and $v=g(x) .$ Then the differentials are $d u=f^{\prime}(x) dx$ and $d v=g^{\prime}(x) d x,$ so, by the Substitution Rule, the formula for integration by parts becomes
      $$
      \int u d v=u v-\int v d u
      $$

      ##### integration by parts
      What does **LIATE** stand for?
    Back: |
      A mnemonic device which is helpful for selecting $u$ when using integration by parts is the LIATE princedence for $u:$

      - Logarithmic
      - Inverse trigonometric
      - Algebraic
      - Trigonometric
      - Exponential

      If the integrand has several factors, then we try to choose among them a $u$ which appears as high as possible on the list. For example, in $\int x e^{2 x} d x$ the integrand is $x e^{2 x},$ which is the product of an algebraic function $(x)$ and an exponential function $\left(e^{2 x}\right) .$ Since Algebraic appears before Exponential, we choose $u=x .$ Sometimes the integration turns out to be similar regardless of the selection of $u$ and $d v,$ but it is advisable to refer to LIATE when in doubt.
