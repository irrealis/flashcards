      CET-06.04-01 Exercise:
      A $360-\text{lb}$ gorilla climbs a tree to a height of $20 \text{ ft}$. Find the work done if the gorilla reaches that height in
      (a) $10 \text{ seconds}$
      (b) $5 \text{ seconds}$
    Back: |
      (a) The work done by the gorilla in lifting its weight of $360 \text{ pounds}$ to a height of $20 \text{ feet}$ is $W=F d=(360 \text{ lb})(20 \text{ ft})=7200 \text{ ft-lb}.$ 
      (b) The amount of time it takes the gorilla to climb the tree doesn't change the amount of work done, so the work done is still $7200 \text{ft-lb}$.
