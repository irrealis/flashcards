      CET-06.04-01 Exercise:
      A $360-\text{lb}$ gorilla climbs a tree to a height of $20 \text{ ft}$. Find the work done if the gorilla reaches that height in
      (a) $10 \text{ seconds}$
      (b) $5 \text{ seconds}$
    Back: |
      (a) The work done by the gorilla in lifting its weight of $360 \text{ pounds}$ to a height of $20 \text{ feet}$ is $W=F d=(360 \text{ lb})(20 \text{ ft})=7200 \text{ ft-lb}.$ 
      (b) The amount of time it takes the gorilla to climb the tree doesn't change the amount of work done, so the work done is still $7200 \text{ft-lb}$.

      SVEC-07.06-02 Exercise:
      When a particle is located a distance $x$ meters from the origin, a force of $\cos (\pi x / 3)$ newtons acts on it. How much work is done in moving the particle from $x=1$ to $x=2 ?$ Interpret your answer by considering the work done from $x=1$ to $x=1.5$ and from $x=1.5$ to $x=2$.

      \end{aligned}
      $$ _Interpretation:_ From $x=1$ to $x=\frac{3}{2},$ the force does work equal to $\int_{1}^{3 / 2} \cos \left(\frac{1}{3} \pi x\right) d x=\frac{3}{\pi}\left(1-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \text{ J}$ in accelerating the particle and increasing its kinetic energy. From $x=\frac{3}{2}$ to $x=2,$ the force opposes the motion of the particle, decreasing its kinetic energy. This is negative work, equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the work done from $x=1$ to $x=\frac{3}{2}$.

      A force of 10 lb is required to hold a spring stretched 4 in. beyond its natural length. How much work is done in stretching it from its natural length to 6 in. beyond its natural length?
    Back: |
      According to Hooke's Law, the force required to maintain a spring stretched $x$ units beyond its natural length (or compressed $x$ units less than its natural length) is proportional to $x,$ that is, $f(x)=k x .$ Here, the amount stretched is 4 in. $=\frac{1}{3} \text{ ft}$ and the force is 10 lb. Thus, $10=k\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \Rightarrow k=30 \text{ lb} / \mathrm{ft},$ and $f(x)=30 x .$ The work done in stretching the spring from its natural length to 6 in. $=\frac{1}{2} \text{ ft}$ beyond its natural length is

      Suppose that $2 \text{ J}$ of work is needed to stretch a spring from its natural length of $30 \text{ cm}$ to a length of $42 \text{ cm} .$
      (a) How much work is needed to stretch the spring from $35 \text{ cm}$ to $40 \text{ cm} ?$

      A chain lying on the ground is $10 \text{ m}$ long and its mass is $80 \text{ kg} .$ How much work is required to raise one end of the chain to a height of $6 \text{ m} ?$
    Back: |
      Assumptions:
      1. After lifting, the chain is L-shaped, with $4 \text{ m}$ of the chain lying along the ground.
      2. The chain slides effortlessly and without friction along the ground while its end is lifted.
      3. The weight density of the chain is constant throughout its length and therefore equals $(8 \text{ kg} / \mathrm{m})\left(9.8 \text{ m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)=78.4 \text{ N} / \mathrm{m}$.
      The part of the chain $x \text{ m}$ from the lifted end is raised $6-x \text{ m}$ if $0 \leq x \leq 6 \text{ m},$ and it is lifted $0 \text{ m}$ if $x>6 \text{ m}$.
      Thus, the work needed is

      A bucket that weighs $4 \text{ lb}$ and a rope of negligible weight are used to draw water from a well that is $80 \text{ ft}$ deep. The bucket is filled with $40 \text{ lb}$ of water and is pulled up at a rate of $2 \text{ ft} / \mathrm{s}$, but water leaks out of a hole in the bucket at a rate of $0.2 \text{ lb} / \mathrm{s}$. Find the work done in pulling the bucket to the top of the well.
    Back: |
      The work needed to lift the bucket itself is $4 \text{ lb}\cdot 80 \text{ ft}=320 \text{ ft}-\mathrm{lb}$. At time $t$ (in seconds) the bucket is $x_{i}^{*}=2 t$ ft above its original $80 \text{ ft}$ depth, but it now holds only $(40-0.2 t)$ lb of water. In terms of distance, the bucket holds $\left[40-0.2\left(\frac{1}{2} x_{i}^{*}\right)\right] \text{lb}$ of water when it is $x_{i}^{*}$ ft above its original $80 \text{ ft}$ depth. Moving this amount of water a distance $\Delta x$ requires $\left(40-\frac{1}{10} x_{i}^{*}\right) \Delta x \text{ ft}-\mathrm{lb}$ of work. Thus, the work needed to lift the water is
      $$
      \begin{aligned}
      W
      &=\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(40-\frac{1}{10} x_{i}^{*}\right) \Delta x \\

      &=(3200-320) \text{ ft}-\mathrm{lb}

      CET-06.04-29 Exercise:
      SVEC-07.06-19 Exercise:
      When gas expands in a cylinder with radius $r,$ the pressure at any given time is a function of the volume: $P=P(V)$ The force exerted by the gas on the piston (see the figure) is the product of the pressure and the area: $F=\pi r^{2} P .$ Show that the work done by the gas when the volume expands from volume $V_{1}$ to volume $V_{2}$ is
      $$
      W=\int_{V_{1}}^{V_{2}} P d V

      $V=\pi r^{2} x,$ so $V$ is a function of $x$ and $P$ can also be regarded as a function of $x .$ If $V_{1}=\pi r^{2} x_{1}$ and $V_{2}=\pi r^{2} x_{2},$ then

      CET-06.04-30 Exercise:
      SVEC-07.06-20 Exercise:
      In a steam engine the pressure $P$ and volume $V$ of steam satisfy the equation $P V^{1.4}=k,$ where $k$ is a constant. (This is true for adiabatic expansion, that is, expansion in which there is no heat transfer between the cylinder and its surroundings.) Use Exercise CET-06.05-29 to calculate the work done by the engine during a cycle when the steam starts at a pressure of $160 \text{ lb} / \mathrm{in}^{2}$ and a volume of $100 \text{ in}^{3}$ and expands to a volume of $800 \text{in}^{3}$
    Back: |
      $160 \text{ lb} / \mathrm{in}^{2}=160 \cdot 144 \text{ lb} / \mathrm{t}^{2},$ $100 \text{ in}^{3}=\frac{100}{1728} \text{ ft}^{3},$ and $800 \text{ in}^{3}=\frac{800}{1728} \text{ ft}^{3}$.
      $k=P V^{1.4}=(160 \cdot 144)\left(\frac{100}{1728}\right)^{1.4}=23,040\left(\frac{25}{432}\right)^{1.4} \approx 426.5 .$ Therefore, $P \approx 426.5 V^{-1.4}$ and
      $$
      \begin{aligned}
      W
      &=\int_{100 / 17728}^{800 / 1728} 426.5 V^{-1.4} d V \\
      &=426.5\left[\frac{1}{0.4} V^{-0.4}\right]_{25 / 432}^{25 / 54} \\
      &=(426.5)(2.5)\left[\left(\frac{432}{25}\right)^{0.4}-\left(\frac{54}{25}\right)^{0.4}\right] \\
      &\approx 1.88 \times 10^{3} \text{ ft}\mathrm{lb}

      SVEC-07.06-24 Exercise:
      The Great Pyramid of King Khufu was built of limestone in Egypt over a 20-year time period from 2580 BC to 2560 BC. Its base is a square with side length $756 \text{ ft}$ and its height when built was $481 \text{ ft}$. (It was the tallest manmade structure in the world for more than 3800 years. The density of the limestone is about $150 \text{ lb} / \mathrm{ft}^{3} .$
      (a) Estimate the total work done in building the pyramid.
      (b) If each laborer worked 10 hours a day for 20 years, for 340 days a year, and did $200 \text{ ft}\mathrm{-lb}/\mathrm{h}$ of work in lifting the limestone blocks into place, about how many laborers were needed to construct the pyramid?
