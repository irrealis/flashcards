      Define **parabola**, **focus**, **vertex**, **axis**, **directrix**.
    Back: |
      A **parabola** is the set of points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed point $F$ (called the **focus**) and a fixed line (called the **directrix**). This definition is illustrated below.
      <p align="center">
      ![](CET-10.05-03.Sy.1.jpg)
      </p>
      Notice that the point halfway between the focus and the directrix lies on the parabola; it is called the **vertex**. The line through the focus perpendicular to the directrix is called the **axis** of the parabola.

      The standard equation for a parabola centered around a vertical line with vertex $(h, k)$ and focus $(h, k+p)$ is
      $$
      (x-h)^{2}=4 p(y-k)
      $$
      <p align="center">
      ![](CET-10.05-03.Sy.2.jpg)
      $y=\frac{1}{8}(x-2)^{2}+2$

      ##### Conic Sections
      Define **ellipse**, **foci**, **vertices**, **co-vertices**, **major axis**, **minor axis**, **center**.
    Back: |
      An **ellipse** is the set of points in a plane the sum of whose distances from two fixed points $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ is a constant (see figure below). These two fixed points are called the **foci** (plural of focus).
      <p align="center">
      ![](CET-10.05-04.Sy.1.jpg)
      </p>
      The point midway between the foci is called the **center** (the origin in the following figure). The line containing both foci (points $(\pm c, 0$) in the figure) intersects the ellipse at two points called **vertices** (points $(\pm a, 0)$ in the figure). The line segment joining these vertices is called the **major axis**. The line through the center that is perpendicular to the major axis intersects the ellipse at two points called **co-vertices** (points $(0, \pm b)$ in the figure). The line segment joining these co-vectors is called the **minor axis**.
      <p align="center">
      ![](CET-10.05-04.Sy.2.jpg)
      </p>
      The standard equation for an ellipse centered at $(h, k)$ with vertices $(\pm a+h, k)$ is described by the equation
      $$
      \frac{(x-h)^{2}}{a^{2}}+\frac{(y-k)^{2}}{b^{2}}=1
      $$ $(a \geq b>0) .$ The foci exist at $(\pm c+h, k)$ where $c^{2}=a^{2}-b^{2}.$
      <p align="center">
      ![](CET-10.05-04.Sy.3.jpg)
      $\frac{(x-2)^{2}}{4}+\frac{(y-2)^{2}}{1}=1$

      ##### Conic Sections
      Define **hyperbola**, **foci**, **vertices**, **axis**, **center**, **branches**, **asymptotes**.
    Back: |
      A **hyperbola** is the set of all points in a plane the difference of whose distances from two fixed points $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ (the **foci**) is a constant. This definition is illustrated below.
      <p align="center">
      ![](CET-10.05-05.Sy.1.jpg)
      $P$ is on the hyperbola when $\left|P F_{1}\right|-\left|P F_{2}\right|=\pm 2 a.$
      </p>
      Notice that the definition of a hyperbola is similar to that of an ellipse; the only change is that the sum of distances has become a difference of distances.  The point midway between the foci is called the **center** (the origin in the following figure). The line containing both foci (points $(\pm c, 0$) in the figure) is called the **axis** and intersects the hyperbola at two points called **vertices** (points $(\pm a, 0)$ in the figure). The two distinct pieces of the hyperbola are called the **branches** (red in the figure).  When we draw a hyperbola it is useful to first draw its **asymptotes**, which are the dashed lines $y=(b / a) x$ and $y=-(b / a) x$ shown below. Both branches of the hyperbola approach the asymptotes; that is, they come arbitrarily close to the asymptotes.
      <p align="center">
      ![](CET-10.05-05.Sy.2.jpg)
      $$
      \frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}-\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1
      $$
      </p>
      The standard equation for a hyperbola centered at $(h, k)$ with vertices $(\pm a+h, k)$ is described by the equation
      $$
      \frac{(x-h)^{2}}{a^{2}}-\frac{(y-k)^{2}}{b^{2}}=1
      $$ $(a \geq b>0).$ The foci exist at $(\pm c+h, k)$ where $c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}.$ The axis corresponds to the variable with positive sign in the above expression. The asymptotes are the lines $y-k = \pm(b/a)(x-h).$
      <p align="center">
      ![](CET-10.05-05.Sy.3.jpg)
      $$
      \frac{(x-2)^{2}}{4}-\frac{(y-2)^{2}}{1}=1
      $$
