      State the **Power to Taylor Coefficients Theorem** (my own term). What are **Taylor coefficients?**
    Back: |
      If $f$ has a power series representation (expansion) at $a,$ that is, if
      $$
      f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_{n}(x-a)^{n} \quad|x-a|<R
      $$ then its coefficients are given by the formula
      $$
      c_{n}=\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n !}
      $$ The numbers $c_{n}$ are called **Taylor coefficients.**

      State the **Power to Taylor Series Theorem** (my own term).  Define the **Taylor series of the function $f$ at $a$** (or **about $a$** or **centered at $a$**).
    Back: |
      If $f$ has a power series expansion at $a$, then it must be of the following form.
      $$
      \begin{aligned}
      f(x) &=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n !}(x-a)^{n} \\
      &=f(a)+\frac{f^{\prime}(a)}{1 !}(x-a)+\frac{f^{\prime \prime}(a)}{2 !}(x-a)^{2}+\frac{f^{\prime \prime \prime}(a)}{3 !}(x-a)^{3}+\cdots
      \end{aligned}
      $$ This series is called the **Taylor series of the function $f$ at $a$.**

      This theorem can be restated as follows: if $f$ can be represented as a power series about $a$, then $f$ is equal to the sum of its Taylor series.

      **Note:** there exist functions that are not equal to the sum of their Taylor series.

      Define the **Maclaurin series of the function $f$.**
    Back: |
      For the special case $a=0$ the Taylor series becomes
      $$
      f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n !} x^{n}=f(0)+\frac{f^{\prime}(0)}{1 !} x+\frac{f^{\prime \prime}(0)}{2 !} x^{2}+\cdots
      $$ This case arises frequently enough that it is given the special name **Maclaurin series**.

      The polynomial $T_{n}(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{n} \frac{f^{(i)}(a)}{i !}(x-a)^{i}$ and remainder $R_{n}(x) = f(x) - T_{n}(x)$ appearing in Taylor's theorem are the **$n$th-degree Taylor polynomial of $f$ at $a$** and the corresponding **remainder,** respectively.

      If $f(x)=T_{n}(x)+R_{n}(x),$ where $T_{n}$ is the $n$ th-degree Taylor polynomial of $f$ at $a$ and
      $$
      \lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} R_{n}(x)=0
      $$ for $|x-a|<R,$ then $f$ is equal to the sum of its Taylor series on the interval $|x-a|<R$.

      If the function $f$ is $n$ times differentiable at $a$ then there is a function $R_{n}(x)$ such that

      T_{n}(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{n} \frac{f^{(i)}(a)}{i !}(x-a)^{i}

      \lim_{x \rightarrow a} R_n(x) = 0
