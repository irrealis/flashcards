      Suppose $f(x)$ is defined when $x$ is near the number $a .$ (This means that $f$ is defined on some open interval that contains $a$ except possibly at $a$ itself.) Then we write
      $$
      \lim _{x \rightarrow a} f(x)=L
      $$ and say "the limit of $f(x),$ as $x$ approaches $a,$ equals $L$" if we can make the values of $f(x)$ arbitrarily close to $L$ (as close to $L$ as we like) by restricting $x$ to be sufficiently close to $a$ (on either side of $a$ ) but not equal to $a$.

      Give the **Intuitive Definition of One-Sided Limits.**

      We write
      $$
      \lim _{x \rightarrow a^{-}} f(x)=L
      $$ and say "the left-hand limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ [or the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ from the left] is equal to $L$" if we can make the values of $f(x)$ arbitrarily close to $L$ by taking $x$ to be sufficiently close to $a$ with $x$ less than $a$.

      Similarly, if we require that $x$ be greater than $a$, we get "the right-hand limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ is equal to $L$" and we write
      $$
      \lim _{x \rightarrow a^{+}} f(x)=L
      $$

      ##### infinite limits
      Give the **Intuitive Definition of an Infinite Limit.**
    Back: |
      Let $f$ be a function defined on both sides of $a,$ except possibly at $a$ itself. Then
      $$
      \lim _{x \rightarrow a} f(x)=\infty
      $$ means that the values of $f(x)$ can be made arbitrarily large (as large as we please) by taking $x$ sufficiently close to $a,$ but not equal to $a$.

      Similarly,
      $$
      \lim _{x \rightarrow a} f(x)=-\infty
      $$ means that the values of $f(x)$ can be made arbitrarily large negative by taking $x$ sufficiently close to $a,$ but not equal to $a$.

      Define **vertical asymptote.**
    Back: |
      The vertical line $x=a$ is called a vertical asymptote of the curve $y=f(x)$ if at least one of the following statements is true:
      $$
      \begin{array}{rclrclrcl}
      \lim _{x \rightarrow a} f(x) &=& \infty & \lim _{x \rightarrow a^{-}} f(x) &=& \infty & \lim _{x \rightarrow a^{+}} f(x) &=& \infty \\
      \lim _{x \rightarrow a} f(x) &=& -\infty & \lim _{x \rightarrow a^{-}} f(x) &=& -\infty & \lim _{x \rightarrow a^{+}} f(x) &=& -\infty \\
      \end{array}
      $$
