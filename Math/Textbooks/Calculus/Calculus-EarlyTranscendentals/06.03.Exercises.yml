      CET-06.03-01 Exercise:
      Let $S$ be the solid obtained by rotating the region shown in the figure about the $y$ -axis. Explain why it is awkward to use slicing to find the volume $V$ of $S .$ Sketch a typical approximating shell. What are its circumference and height? Use shells to find $V.$

      If we were to use the "washer" method, we would first have to locate the local maximum point $(a, b)$ of $y=x(x-1)^{2}$ using the methods of Chapter $4 .$ Then we would have to solve the equation $y=x(x-1)^{2}$ for $x$ in terms of $y$ to obtain the functions $x=g_{1}(y)$ and $x=g_{2}(y)$ shown in the first figure. This step would be difficult because it involves the cubic formula. Finally we would find the volume using
      $$$
      V=\pi \int_{0}^{b}\left\{\left[g_{1}(y)\right]^{2}-\left[g_{2}(y)\right]^{2}\right\} d y
      $$$

      Using shells, we find that a typical approximating shell has radius $x,$ so its circumference is $2 \pi x .$ Its height is $y,$ that is, $x(x-1)^{2} .$ So the total volume is
      $$$
      \begin{aligned}
        V
        &=\int_{0}^{1} 2 \pi x\left[x(x-1)^{2}\right] d x \\
        &=2 \pi \int_{0}^{1}\left(x^{4}-2 x^{3}+x^{2}\right) d x \\
        &=2 \pi\left[\frac{x^{5}}{5}-2 \frac{x^{4}}{4}+\frac{x^{3}}{3}\right]_{0}^{1} \\
        &=\frac{\pi}{15}
      \end{aligned}
      $$$
