    Back: |
      The SI unit for measuring pressure is a newton per square meter, which is called a pascal (abbreviation: $1 \text{ N} / \mathrm{m}^{2}=1 \mathrm{Pa}$ ). Since this is a small unit, the kilopascal $\text{(kPa)}$ is often used.

      In general, suppose that a thin horizontal plate with area $A$ square meters is submerged in a fluid of density $\rho$ kilograms per cubic meter at a depth $d$ meters below the surface of the fluid as in Figure $1 .$ The fluid directly above the plate (think of a column of liquid) has volume $V=A d,$ so its mass is $m=\rho V=\rho A d .$ The force exerted by the fluid on the plate is therefore
      $$
      F=m g=\rho g A d
      $$

      **Simple center of mass**: Suppose that a balanced rod lies along the $x$axis with masses $m_{1}$ at $x_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ at $x_{2}$ as shown below.

      Where is the center of mass $\overline{x}?$
    Back: |
      Setting $d_{1}=\overline{x}-x_{1}$ and $d_{2}=x_{2}-\overline{x}$ gives
      $$
      \begin{aligned}
      m_{1}\left(\overline{x}-x_{1}\right)= m_1 d_1 &= m_2 d_2 = m_{2}\left(x_{2}-\overline{x}\right) \\
      m_{1} \overline{x}+m_{2} \overline{x} &=m_{1} x_{1}+m_{2} x_{2} \\
      \overline{x} &=\frac{m_{1} x_{1}+m_{2} x_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}
      \end{aligned}
      $$ This says that the center of mass $\overline{x}$ is obtained by adding the moments of the masses and dividing by the total mass $m=m_{1}+m_{2}.$

      $$
      \overline{x}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} m_{i} x_{i}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} m_{i}}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} m_{i} x_{i}}{m}
      $$ where $m=\Sigma m_{i}$ is the total mass of the system.  This could be rewritten as $m \overline{x}=M=\sum_{i=1}^{n} m_{i} x_{i} ,$ which says that if the total mass were considered as being concentrated at the center of mass $\overline{x},$ then its moment would be the same as the moment $M$ of the system.

      Define **discrete 2D system center of mass**.
    Back: |
      In general, if we have a system of $n$ particles with masses $m_{1}, m_{2}, \ldots, m_{n}$ located at the points $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right),\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right), \ldots,\left(x_{n}, y_{n}\right)$ in the $x y$ plane, where is the center of mass $(\overline{x}, \overline{y})?$

      As in the one-dimensional case, the coordinates $(\overline{x}, \overline{y})$ of the center of mass are given in terms of the moments $M_y$ and $M_x$ about the $y$ and $x$ axes by the formulas
      $$
      \overline{x}=\frac{M_{y}}{m} \quad \overline{y}=\frac{M_{x}}{m}
      $$ where $m=\sum m_{i}$ is the total mass. Since $m \overline{x}=M_{y}$ and $m \overline{y}=M_{x},$ the center of mass $(\overline{x}, \overline{y})$ is the point where a single particle of mass $m$ would have the same moments as the system.
