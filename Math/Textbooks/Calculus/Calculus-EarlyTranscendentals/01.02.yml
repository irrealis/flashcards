      We notice from the figure that $g$ and $h$ are even functions (symmetric with respect to the $y$ -axis) and that $f$ is an odd function (symmetric with respect to the origin). So (b) $\left[y=x^{5}\right]$ must be $f .$ Since $g$ is flatter than $h$ near the origin, we must have (c) $\left[y=x^{8}\right]$ matched with $g$ and (a) $\left[y=x^{2}\right]$ matched with $h .$

      $f(x)=\frac{\cos x}{1-\sin x}$

      The denominator cannot equal $0,$ so $1-\sin x \neq 0 \Leftrightarrow \sin x \neq 1 \Leftrightarrow x \neq \frac{\pi}{2}+2 n \pi .$ Thus, the domain of $f(x)=\frac{\cos x}{1-\sin x}$ is $\left\{x | x \neq \frac{\pi}{2}+2 n \pi, n \text { an integer }\right\}.$

      (a) Find an equation for the family of linear functions with slope 2 and sketch several members of the family.
      (b) Find an equation for the family of linear functions such that $f(2)=1$ and sketch several members of the family.
      (c) Which function belongs to both families?
    Back: |
      (a) An equation for the family of linear functions with slope 2 $\quad$ is $y=f(x)=2 x+b,$ where $b$ is the $y$ -intercept.

      ![](CET-01.02-07.1.jpg)

      (b) $f(2)=1$ means that the point $(2,1)$ is on the graph of $f .$ We can use the point-slope form of a line to obtain an equation for the family of linear functions through the point $(2,1) . \quad y-1=m(x-2),$ which is equivalent to $y=m x+(1-2 m)$ in slope-intercept form.

      ![](CET-01.02-07.2.jpg)

      (c) To belong to both families, an equation must have slope $m=2,$ so the equation in part $(b), y=m x+(1-2 m),$ becomes $y=2 x-3 .$ It is the only function that belongs to both families.

      CET 01.02 10: Find expressions for the quadratic functions whose graphs are shown.

      ![](CET-01.02-10.1.jpg)
    Back: |
      The vertex of the parabola on the left is $(3,0),$ so an equation is $y=a(x-3)^{2}+0 .$ Since the point $(4,2)$ is on the parabola, we'll substitute 4 for $x$ and 2 for $y$ to find $a$. $2=a(4-3)^{2} \Rightarrow a=2,$ so an equation is $f(x)=2(x-3)^{2}$.

      The $y$ -intercept of the parabola on the right is $(0,1),$ so an equation is $y=a x^{2}+b x+1 .$ Since the points $(-2,2)$ and $(1,-2.5)$ are on the parabola, we'll substitute $-2$ for $x$ and 2 for $y$ as well as 1 for $x$ and $-2.5$ for $y$ to obtain two equations with the unknowns $a$ and $b$.

      $$$$\begin{array}{lll}{(-2,2):} & {2=4 a-2 b+1 \Rightarrow 4 a-2 b=1} & {\qquad (1)} \\ {(1,-2.5):} & {-2.5=a+b+1 \Rightarrow a+b=-3.5} & {\qquad (2)} \end{array}$$$$

      $2 \cdot(2)+(1)$ gives us $6 a=-6 \Rightarrow a=-1 .$ From $(2),-1+b=-3.5 \Rightarrow b=-2.5,$ so an equation is $g(x)=-x^{2}-2.5 x+1.$

      Since $f(-1)=f(0)=f(2)=0, f$ has zeros of $-1,0,$ and $2,$ so an equation for $f$ is $f(x)=a[x-(-1)](x-0)(x-2),$ or $f(x)=a x(x+1)(x-2) .$ Because $f(1)=6,$ we'll substitute 1 for $x$ and 6 for $f(x).$ $6=a(1)(2)(-1) \Rightarrow-2 a=6 \Rightarrow a=-3,$ so an equation for $f$ is $f(x)=-3 x(x+1)(x-2).$

      CET 01.02 12: Recent studies indicate that the average surface temperature of the earth has been rising steadily. Some scientists have modeled the temperature by the linear function $T=0.02 t+8.50$, where $T$ is temperature in $^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $t$ represents years since 1900.
      (a) What do the slope and $T$ -intercept represent?
      (b) Use the equation to predict the average global surface temperature in 2100.
    Back: |
      (a) For $T=0.02 t+8.50$, the slope is 0.02, which means that the average surface temperature of the world is increasing at a rate of $0.02^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ per year. The $T$-intercept is 8.50, which represents the average surface temperature in $^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in the year 1900.

      (b) $t=2100-1900=200 \Rightarrow T=0.02(200)+8.50=12.50^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$

    Back: |
      (a) $D=200,$ so $c=0.0417 D(a+1)=0.0417(200)(a+1)=8.34 a+8.34$. The slope is $8.34,$ which represents the change in $\mathrm{mg}$ of the dosage for a child for each change of 1 year in age.

      (b) For a newborn, $a=0,$ so $c=8.34 \mathrm{mg}$.
