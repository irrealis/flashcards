      (Note: a correct proof uses induction.)

      We start by supposing that $f$ is any function that can be represented by a power series
      [CET-11.10 Eqn. 1]
      $$
      f(x)=c_{0}+c_{1}(x-a)+c_{2}(x-a)^{2}+c_{3}(x-a)^{3}+c_{4}(x-a)^{4}+\cdots
      $$ with $|x-a|<R$.
      Let's try to determine what the coefficients $c_{n}$ must be in terms of $f .$ To begin, notice that if we put $x=a$ in equation (1) then all terms after the first one are 0 and we get
      $$
      f(a)=c_{0}
      $$
      By the term-by-term differentiation and integration theorem we can differentiate the series in equation (1) term by term:
      [CET-11.10 Eqn. 2]
      $$
      f^{\prime}(x)=c_{1}+2 c_{2}(x-a)+3 c_{3}(x-a)^{2}+4 c_{4}(x-a)^{3}+\cdots
      $$ and substitution of $x=a$ in equation (2) gives
      $$
      f^{\prime}(a)=c_{1}
      $$ Now we differentiate both sides of equation (2) and obtain
      [CET-11.10 Eqn. 3]
      $$
      f^{\prime \prime}(x)=2 c_{2}+2 \cdot 3 c_{3}(x-a)+3 \cdot 4 c_{4}(x-a)^{2}+\cdots
      $$ Again we put $x=a$ in equation (3). The result is
      $$
      f^{\prime \prime}(a)=2 c_{2}
      $$ Let's apply the procedure one more time. Differentiation of the series in equation (3) gives
      [CET-11.10 Eqn. 4]
      $$
      f^{\prime \prime \prime}(x)=2 \cdot 3 c_{3}+2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 c_{4}(x-a)+3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 c_{5}(x-a)^{2}+\cdots
      $$ and substitution of $x=a$ in equation (4) gives
      $$
      f^{\prime \prime \prime}(a)=2 \cdot 3 c_{3}=3 ! c_{3}
      $$ By now you can see the pattern. If we continue to differentiate and substitute $x=a$, we obtain
      $$
      f^{(n)}(a)=2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot \cdots \cdot n c_{n}=n ! c_{n}
      $$ Solving this equation for the $n$ th coefficient $c_{n},$ we get
      $$
      c_{n}=\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n !}
      $$ This formula remains valid even for $n=0$ if we adopt the conventions that $0 !=1$ and $f^{(0)}=f .$ Thus we have proved the theorem.

      CET-11.10-02 Proof:
      Prove the **Power to Taylor Series Theorem** (my own term).
    Back: |
      If $f$ has a power series representation (expansion) at $a,$ that is, if
      $$
      f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_{n}(x-a)^{n} \quad|x-a|<R
      $$ then by the Power to Taylor Coefficients Theorem, its coefficients are given by the formula
      $$
      c_{n}=\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n !}
      $$ Substituting this formula for $c_{n}$ back into the series, we see that if $f$ has a power series expansion at $a$, then it must be of the desired form
      $$
      \begin{aligned}
      f(x) &=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n !}(x-a)^{n} \\
      &=f(a)+\frac{f^{\prime}(a)}{1 !}(x-a)+\frac{f^{\prime \prime}(a)}{2 !}(x-a)^{2}+\frac{f^{\prime \prime \prime}(a)}{3 !}(x-a)^{3}+\cdots
      \end{aligned}
      $$

      CET-11.10-03 Proof: [CET-11.10 Eqn. 8]
      Prove **Taylor's theorem.**
    Back: |
      If $f(x)=T_{n}(x)+R_{n}(x),$ where $T_{n}$ is the $n$ th-degree Taylor polynomial of $f$ at $a$ and
      $$
      \lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} R_{n}(x)=0
      $$ for $|x-a|<R,$ then it follows that
      $$
      \lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} T_{n}(x)=\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left[f(x)-R_{n}(x)\right]=f(x)-\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} R_{n}(x)=f(x)
      $$ That is, $f$ is equal to the sum of its Taylor series on the interval $|x-a|<R$.
