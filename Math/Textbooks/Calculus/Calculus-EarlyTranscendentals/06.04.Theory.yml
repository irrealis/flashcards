      State **Newton's Second Law of Motion** for an object moving along a straight line with position function $s(t).$
    Back: |
      In general, if an object moves along a straight line with position function $s(t),$ then the force $F$ on the object (in the same direction) is given by Newton's Second Law of Motion as the product of its mass $m$ and its acceleration $a$:
      $$$
      F=m a=m \frac{d^{2} s}{d t^{2}}
      $$$

      What are the units of force in the SI system? in the US Customary system?
    Back: |
      In the SI metric system, the mass is measured in kilograms ($\mathrm{kg}$), the displacement in meters ($\mathrm{m}$), the time in seconds ($\mathrm{s}$), and the force in newtons ($\mathrm{N}=\mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$).  Thus a force of $1 \text{ N}$ acting on a mass of $1 \text{ kg}$ produces an acceleration of $1 \text{ m} / \mathrm{s}^{2} .$ In the US Customary system the fundamental unit is chosen to be the unit of force, which is the pound.

      Define **work** in the case of constant acceleration.
    Back: |
      In the case of constant acceleration, the force $F$ is also constant and the work done is defined to be the product of the force $F$ and the distance $d$ that the object moves:
      $$$
      W=F d \quad \text{work $=$ force $\times$ distance}
      $$$

      What are the units of work in the SI system? in the US Customary system? How are they related?
    Back: |
      If $F$ is measured in newtons and $d$ in meters, then the unit for $W$ is a newton-meter, which is called a joule ($\text{J}$). If $F$ is measured in pounds and $d$ in feet, then the unit for $W$ is a foot-pound ($\mathrm{ft}-\mathrm{lb}$), which is about $1.36 \text{ J}.$

      CET-06.04-05 Theory:
      How is **work** defined when force is variable?
    Back: |
      Let's suppose that an object moves along the $x$ -axis in the positive direction, from $x=a$ to $x=b,$ and at each point $x$ between $a$ and $b$ a force $f(x)$ acts on the object, where $f$ is a continuous function. We divide the interval $[a, b]$ into $n$ subintervals with endpoints $x_{0}, x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}$ and equal width $\Delta x .$ We choose a sample point $x_{i}^{*}$ in the ith subinterval $\left[x_{i-1}, x_{i}\right] .$ Then the force at that point is $f\left(x_{i}^{*}\right) .$ If $n$ is large, then $\Delta x$ is small, and since $f$ is continuous, the values of $f$ don't change very much over the interval $\left[x_{i-1}, x_{i}\right] .$ In other words, $f$ is almost constant on the interval and so the work $W_{i}$ that is done in moving the particle from $x_{i-1}$ to $x_{i}$ is approximately given by:
      $$$
      W_{i} \approx f\left(x_{i}^{*}\right) \Delta x
      $$$ Thus we can approximate the total work by
      $$$
      W \approx \sum_{i=1}^{n} f\left(x_{i}^{*}\right) \Delta x
      $$$ We define the **work done in moving the object from $a$ to $b$** as the limit of this quantity as $n \rightarrow \infty$. Since the right side is a Riemann sum, we recognize its limit as being a definite integral and so
      $$$
      W=\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} sum_{i=1}^{n} f\left(x_{i}^{*}\right) \Delta x=\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x
      $$$

      State **Hooke's Law.**
    Back: |
      Hooke's Law states that the force required to maintain a spring stretched $x$ units beyond its natural length is proportional to $x:$
      $$$
      f(x)=k x
      $$$ where $k$ is a positive constant called the spring constant (see figure below).

      Hooke's Law holds provided that $x$ is not too large.
