      CET-08.02-01 Proof:
      Derive the band area $A$ of a cone of radius $r$ and slant height $h$.
    Back: |
      We can take a circular cone with base radius $r$ and slant height $l,$ cut it along the dashed line in the figure below, and flatten it to form a sector of a circle with radius $l$ and central angle $\theta=2 \pi r / l .$

      </p>
      We know that, in general, the area of a sector of a circle with radius $l$ and angle $\theta$ is $\frac{1}{2} l^{2} \theta$ (see Exercise 7.3.35) and so in this case the area is
      $$
      A=\frac{1}{2} l^{2} \theta=\frac{1}{2} l^{2}\left(\frac{2 \pi r}{l}\right)=\pi r l
      $$ Therefore we define the lateral surface area of a cone to be $A=\pi r l.$
      $\square$

      CET-08.02-02 Proof:
      Derive the area $A$ of a cone band with slant height $l$ and upper and lower radii $r_1$ and $r_2$.
    Back: |
      The band can be considered a portion of a circular cone, as shown below.

      </p>
      The area of the band (or frustum of a cone) with slant height $l$ and upper and lower radii $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ is found by subtracting the areas of two cones:
      $$
      A=\pi r_{2}\left(l_{1}+l\right)-\pi r_{1} l_{1}=\pi\left[\left(r_{2}-r_{1}\right) l_{1}+r_{2} l\right]
      $$ From similar triangles we have
      $$
      \frac{l_{1}}{r_{1}}=\frac{l_{1}+l}{r_{2}}
      $$ which gives
      $$
      r_{2} l_{1}=r_{1} l_{1}+r_{1} l \quad \text { or } \quad\left(r_{2}-r_{1}\right) l_{1}=r_{1} l
      $$ Putting this into the formula for $A,$ we get
      $$
      A = \pi (r_1 l + r_2 l) = \pi (r_1 + r_2) l
      $$ or
      $$
      A = 2 \pi r l \quad\text{where}\quad r = \tfrac{1}{2}(r_1 + r_2)
      $$ $\square$

      CET-08.02-03 Proof:
      Derive the Riemann approximation to the area of the complete surface of revolution.
    Back: |
      Consider the surface shown below, obtained by rotating the curve $y=f(x), a \leqslant x \leqslant b,$ about the $x$ -axis, where $f$ is positive and has a continuous derivative.

      _Approximating band_ 
      </p> 
      In order to define its surface area, we divide the interval $[a, b]$ into $n$ subintervals with endpoints $x_{0}, x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}$ and equal width $\Delta x$ as we did in determining arc length. If $y_{i}=f\left(x_{i}\right),$ then the point $P_{i}\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\right)$ lies on the curve. The part of the surface between $x_{i-1}$ and $x_{i}$ is approximated by taking the line segment $P_{i-1} P_{i}$ and rotating it about the $x$ -axis. The result is a band with slant height $l=\left|P_{i-1} P_{i}\right|$ and average radius $r=\frac{1}{2}\left(y_{i-1}+y_{i}\right)$ so its surface area is 
      $$ 
      2 \pi \frac{y_{i-1}+y_{i}}{2}\left|P_{i-1} P_{i}\right| 
      $$ As in the proof of Theorem $8.1 .2,$ we have 
      $$ 
      \left|P_{i-1} P_{i}\right|=\sqrt{1+\left[f^{\prime}\left(x_{i}^{*}\right)\right]^{2}} \Delta x 
      $$ where $x_{i}^{*}$ is some number in $\left[x_{i-1}, x_{i}\right] .$ When $\Delta x$ is small, we have $y_{i}=f\left(x_{i}^{*}\right)$ and also $y_{i-1}=f\left(x_{i-1}\right) \approx f\left(x_{i}^{*}\right),$ since $f$ is continuous. Therefore 
      $$ 
      2 \pi \frac{y_{i-1}+y_{i}}{2}\left|P_{i-1} P_{i}\right| \approx 2 \pi f\left(x_{i}^{*}\right) \sqrt{1+\left[f^{\prime}\left(x_{i}^{*}\right)\right]^{2}} \Delta x 
      $$ and so an approximation to what we think of as the area of the complete surface of revolution is 
      $$ 
      \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2 \pi f\left(x_{i}^{*}\right) \sqrt{1+\left[f^{\prime}\left(x_{i}^{*}\right)\right]^{2}} \Delta x 
      $$ $\square$

      CET-08.02-04 Proof: 
      Derive the surface area of the surface obtained by rotating the curve $y=f(x),$ $a \leqslant x \leqslant b,$ about the $x$-axis, in the case where $f$ is positive and has a continuous derivative.
    Back: |
      An approximation to what we think of as the area of the complete surface of revolution is 
      $$ 
      \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2 \pi f\left(x_{i}^{*}\right) \sqrt{1+\left[f^{\prime}\left(x_{i}^{*}\right)\right]^{2}} \Delta x 
      $$ This approximation appears to become better as $n \rightarrow \infty$ and, recognizing it as a Riemann sum for the function $g(x)=2 \pi f(x) \sqrt{1+\left[f^{\prime}(x)\right]^{2}},$ we have 
      $$ 
      \lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2 \pi f\left(x_{i}^{*}\right) \sqrt{1+\left[f^{\prime}\left(x_{i}^{*}\right)\right]^{2}} \Delta x=\int_{a}^{b} 2 \pi f(x) \sqrt{1+\left[f^{\prime}(x)\right]^{2}} d x 
      $$ Therefore, in the case where $f$ is positive and has a continuous derivative, we define the surface area of the surface obtained by rotating the curve $y=f(x), a \leqslant x \leqslant b,$ about the $x$-axis as 
      $$ 
      S=\int_{a}^{b} 2 \pi f(x) \sqrt{1+\left[f^{\prime}(x)\right]^{2}} d x 
      $$ $\square$
