      Identify which statement below correctly identifies the times at which the velocity of the object is greater than zero.
      (a) The velocity is greater than 0 at $t=0 \text{ s}$ s and $t=4 \text{ s}$.
      (b) The velocity is greater than 0 at $t=2 \text{ s}$.
      (c) The velocity is greater than 0 at $t=0 \text{ s}$ and $t=1 \text{ s}$.
      (d) The velocity is greater than 0 at $t=3 \text{ s}$ and $t=4 \text{ s}$.
      (e) The velocity is greater than 0 at $t=0,1,3,$ and $4 \text{ s}$.

      (d) The velocity is greater than 0 at $t=3 \text{ s}$ and $t=4 \text{ s}$.

      The velocity of an object is defined to be the derivative of the position with respect to time:
      $$
      \overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}} \equiv \frac{d \overrightarrow{\mathbf{x}}}{d t}
      $$ The velocity at time $t$ is just the slope of the position vs time curve at time $t .$ Therefore the **velocity** is **positive** at all times that the **slope** of the position curve is **positive.** In this case, the slope of the position vs time curve is positive for **all times $t>2 \text{ s}$.**

      The graph represents the velocity as a function of time for an object in onedimensional motion. Identify which statement below correctly describes the motion at $t=3 \text{ s}$.

      (a) The object is slowing down and the acceleration is negative.
      (b) The object is speeding up and the acceleration is negative.
      (c) The object is slowing down and the acceleration is positive.
      (d) The object is speeding up and the acceleration is positive.

      (b) The object is speeding up and the acceleration is negative.

      An object **speeds up** or **slows down** depending on whether the **magnitude** of its **velocity** is **increasing** or **decreasing.** In this case, at $t=3 \text{ s}$  the **velocity** is **decreasing** (becoming more negative), but the object is **speeding up** since the **magnitude** of the velocity is **increasing.**

      The **acceleration** is defined as the **derivative** of the **velocity** with respect to **time.** Therefore, the **acceleration** at time $t$ is just equal to the **slope** of the **velocity vs time** curve at any time $t .$ In the case, the **slope** is a **constant;** it has a negative value at all times $\left(-2.5 \text{ m} / \text{s}^{2}\right) .$ Therefore, this object has a **negative acceleration at all times.**
