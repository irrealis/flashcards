      What are some uses of binary search trees?
    Back: |
      - Search for a key.
      - Find min and max elements.
      - Look for successor or predecessor of a given search key.
      - Enumerate the elements in a sorted order.

      What is the runtime complexity of _Depth-First Search_?
    Back: |
      \\(O(|V| + |E|)\\), where \\(V\\) and \\(E\\) are the graph's vertices and edges.

      What is the runtime complexity of _Breadth-First Search_?
    Back: |
      \\(O(|V| + |E|)\\), where \\(V\\) and \\(E\\) are the graph's vertices and edges.
