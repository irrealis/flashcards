    ## 01.16: Search BST for a key

    Searching for a key in a BST is very similar to searching in a sorted array. Recursion is more natural but for performance, a while-loop is preferred.

    Given a BST \\(T\\), first write a recursive function that searches for key \\(K\\), then write an iterative function.

    ## 01.17: Search BST for \\(x > k\\)

    BSTs offer more than the ability to search for a key --- they can be used to find the min and max elements, look for the successor or predecessor of a given search key (which may or may not be present in the BST), and enumerate the elements in a sorted order.

    Given a BST \\(T\\) and a key \\(K\\), write a method that searches for the first entry larger than \\(K\\).
