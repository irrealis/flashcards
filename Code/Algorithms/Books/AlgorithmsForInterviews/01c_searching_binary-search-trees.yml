    ## 01.16: Search BST for a key

    Searching for a key in a BST is very similar to searching in a sorted array. Recursion is more natural but for performance, a while-loop is preferred.

    Given a BST \\(T\\), first write a recursive function that searches for key \\(K\\), then write an iterative function.
