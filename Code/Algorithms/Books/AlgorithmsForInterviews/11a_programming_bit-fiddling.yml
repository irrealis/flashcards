      ## 11.01: Computing the parity of a long

      The parity of a sequence of bits is 1 if the number of ones in the sequence is odd; otherwise, it is 0. By keeping the parity of every word of data, you can check for single-bit errors in storage or transmission. It is fairly straightforward to write a code that computes the parity of a long.

      How would you compute parity if you had to perform the computation for a very large number of longs?
