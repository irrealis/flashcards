    ## 02.02: TeraSort

    The sorting algorithms alluded to above assume that all the data you need to sort will fit in RAM. What if your data will not fit in memory?

    Sort a file containing \\(10^{12}\\) 100-byte strings.

    ## 02.03 Finding the winner and runner-up

    There are 128 players participating in a tennis tournament. Assume that the "\\(x\\) beats \\(y\\)" relationship is transitive, i.e., for all players A, B, and C, if A beats B and B beats C, then A beats C.

    What is the least number of matches we need to organize to find the best player? How many matches do you need to find the best and the second best player?
