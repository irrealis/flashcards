      ## 05.01: Find all occurrences of a substring

      A good string-search algorithm is fundamental to the performance of many applications, and there are several elegant algorithms proposed for it, each with its own tradeoffs. As a result, there is no one perfect answer to it. If someone asks you this question in an interview, the best way to approach this problem would be to work through one good algorithm in detail and discuss the breadth of other algorithms for solving this problem.

      Given two strings \\(s\\) (search string) and \\(T\\) (text), find all occurrences of \\(s\\) in \\(T\\).

      ## 05.02: String matching with unique characters

      Suppose we are looking for a search string \\(S\\) in another string \\(T\\). A naïve algorithm would try to match all the characters in \\(S\\) to characters in \\(T\\) at each offset. The worst-case complexity of the naïve algorithm is \\(\Theta(|S| \cdot |T|)\\) --- consider the case where \\(S\\) is \\(2n\\) zeros, and \\(T\\) is \\(n-1\\) zeros followed by a one.

      The worst-case behavior for the naïve algorithm requires many duplicated characters. Suppose no character occurs more than once in the search string. Devise an algorithm to efficiently search for all occurrences of the search string in the text string.

      ## 05.03: Rotate a string

      Let \\(A\\) be a string of length \\(n\\). If we have enough memory to make a copy of \\(A\\), rotating \\(A\\) by \\(i\\) positions is trivial; we just compute \\(B[j] = A[(i + j) \mod n]\\). If we are given only a constant amount of additional memory \\(c\\), we can rotate the string by \\(c\\) positions a total of \\(k = \lceil\frac{n}{c}\rceil\\) times, but this increases the time complexity to \\(\Theta(n \cdot k)\\).

      Design a \\(\Theta(n)\\) algorithm for rotating a string of \\(n\\) letters to the left by \\(i\\) positions. You are allowed only a constant number of bytes of additional storage.

      ## 05.04: Test rotation

      In Problem 5.3, we faced the problem of efficiently implementing rotation with a limited amount of memory. We now consider the problem of testing if one string is a rotation of another.

      Develop a linear-time algorithm for checking if a string \\(S\\) is a cyclic rotation of another string \\(R\\). (For example, _arc_ is a cyclic rotation of _car_.)

      ## 05.05: Normalize URLs

      A URL is described canonically in the following way:

      ```
      <protocol>://<hostname>:[<port>]/<path>
      ```

      There may be a number of different URL strings that are semantically equivalent. For example, `cnn.com` is equivalent to `http://cnn.com`, and `http://www.ece.utexas.edu/index.html` to `http://www.ece.utexas.edu`. Applications such as web search that deal with URLs need to perform transformations to a URL string to normalize it. The transformations may vary from application to application.

      Implement a function which takes a URL as input and performs the following transformations on it:

      1. make hostname and protocol lowercase,
      2. if it ends in "`index.html`" or "`default.html`", remove the filename,
      3. if protocol field is missing, add "`http://`" at the beginning, and
      4. replace consecutive '`/`' characters by a single '`/`' in the "path" segment of the URL.
