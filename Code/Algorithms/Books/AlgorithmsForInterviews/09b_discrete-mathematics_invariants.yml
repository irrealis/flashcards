      ## 09.07: Even or odd

      Let \\(A\\) be a multiset of integers. Consider the following process: randomly select two elements of \\(A\\). If they are both even or both odd, remove them from the set and insert a new even integer; if not, remove just the even integer.

      What can you say about the last remaining integer as a function of the numbers of even and odd integers initially in \\(A\\)?
