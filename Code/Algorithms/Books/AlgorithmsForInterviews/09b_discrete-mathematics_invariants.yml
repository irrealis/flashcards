      ## 09.07: Even or odd

      Let \\(A\\) be a multiset of integers. Consider the following process: randomly select two elements of \\(A\\). If they are both even or both odd, remove them from the set and insert a new even integer; if not, remove just the even integer.

      What can you say about the last remaining integer as a function of the numbers of even and odd integers initially in \\(A\\)?

      ## 09.08: Gassing up

      Consider a circular route that connects \\(n\\) cities. You need to visit all the \\(n\\) cities and come back to the starting city. In each city, a certain amount of gasoline is kept for you such that the total amount of gasoline on the route is exactly equal to the amount of gasoline needed to go around the circular route once.

      Is it always possible to find a starting point on the route such that you can start there with an empty tank and complete the route? How can you efficiently find this city?

      ## 09.09: Common knowledge

      An explorer comes to an island with 100 inhabitants. Exactly half the inhabitants have blue eyes, and half the inhabitants have green eyes. The green eyes are indicative of a disease that brings all the island inhabitants in danger. There is an understanding on the island that whenever someone learns that they have green eyes, they must leave the island; they never leave the island for any other reason. The inhabitants are too polite to inform anyone else of eye color. There are no other means for the inhabitants to observe the color of their eyes on the island.

      The inhabitants assemble each day at exactly 9:00 AM, they see each other, and then go back to their own houses. They never see anyone else for the rest of the day. Furthermore, they are capable of instant logical reasoning.

      The explorer visits one of their daily assemblies and says, "That's interesting --- some of you have blue eyes and some of you have green eyes".

      What would follow after this event? In particular, why does this observation sadden the inhabitants?

      The explorer seems to have added no new knowledge to the system since each inhabitant can already tell that amongst the inhabitants, some have blue eyes and some have green eyes.

      ## 09.10: Hershey bar

      A Hershey bar is modeled as an \\(m \times n\\) rectangle of \\(m \cdot n\\) pieces. You can take a bar and break it along a horizontal or vertical axis into two bars.

      How would you break a \\(4 \times 4\\) bar into sixteen pieces using as few breaks as possible?

      ## 09.11: \\(n \times n\\) chomp

      Consider an \\(n \times n\\) rectangle in the upper right quadrant in the Cartesian plane, with the lower leftmost point at \\((0,0)\\). The block \\((0,0)\\) is known to contain poison. Two players take turns at taking a bite out of the rectangle. A bite removes a square and all squares above and to the right. The first player to eat the square at \\((0,0)\\) loses.

      Assuming the players have infinite computational resources at their disposal, who will win the game?
