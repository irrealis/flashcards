      ## 09.07: Even or odd

      Let \\(A\\) be a multiset of integers. Consider the following process: randomly select two elements of \\(A\\). If they are both even or both odd, remove them from the set and insert a new even integer; if not, remove just the even integer.

      What can you say about the last remaining integer as a function of the numbers of even and odd integers initially in \\(A\\)?

      ## 09.08: Gassing up

      Consider a circular route that connects \\(n\\) cities. You need to visit all the \\(n\\) cities and come back to the starting city. In each city, a certain amount of gasoline is kept for you such that the total amount of gasoline on the route is exactly equal to the amount of gasoline needed to go around the circular route once.

      Is it always possible to find a starting point on the route such that you can start there with an empty tank and complete the route? How can you efficiently find this city?
