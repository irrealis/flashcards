      ## 04.01: Searching a maze

      It is natural to apply graph models and algorithms to spatial problems. Consider a black and white digitized image of a maze --- white pixels represent open areas and black pixels are walls. There are two special pixels: one is designated the entrance and the other is the exit.

      Given a two-dimensional matrix of black and white entries representing a maze with designated entrance and exit points, find a path from the entrance to the exit, if one exists.

      ## 04.02: Order nodes in a binary tree by depth

      There are various traversals that can be performed on a tree: in-order, pre-order, and post-order are three natural examples.

      How would you efficiently return an array \\(A[0 \ldots h]\\), where \\(h\\) is the height of the tree and \\(A[i]\\) is the head of a linked list of all the nodes in the tree that are at height \\(i\\)?
