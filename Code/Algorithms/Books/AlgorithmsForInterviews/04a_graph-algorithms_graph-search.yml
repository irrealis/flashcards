      ## 04.01: Searching a maze

      It is natural to apply graph models and algorithms to spatial problems. Consider a black and white digitized image of a maze --- white pixels represent open areas and black pixels are walls. There are two special pixels: one is designated the entrance and the other is the exit.

      Given a two-dimensional matrix of black and white entries representing a maze with designated entrance and exit points, find a path from the entrance to the exit, if one exists.
