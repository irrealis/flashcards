      ## 11.14.01: Programming Language Implementation

      Give an example of a language which cannot be parsed by any computer.

    Thoughts: |
      I'm stumped. My snarky response is "body language", but I think it may be possible for AI to understand body language.

      I suspect the answer to this is in the formal definition of "parse", in which case parsing requires a formal grammar without ambiguity. In this definition, natural language cannot be parsed, because it need not conform to any grammar.

      Many expressions in C and C++ can also not be parsed under this definition. For example, the `*` symbol is ambiguous.
