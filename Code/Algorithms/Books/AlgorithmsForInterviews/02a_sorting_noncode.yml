    ## 02.01 Good sorting algorithms

    What is the most efficient sorting algorithm for each of the following situations:

    - A small array of integers.
    - A large array whose entries are random numbers.
    - A large collection of integers that are drawn from a very small range.
    - A large collection of numbers most of which are duplicates.
    - Stability is required, i.e., the relative order of two records that have the same sorting key should not be changed.
