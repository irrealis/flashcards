      ## 11.13.03: Best Practices

      Give an example of how inheritance violates encapsulation.

      --- Aziz and Prakash; _Algorithms for Interviews_; version 1.0.0 (September 1, 2010); p 95.

    Thoughts: |
      When people say this, by encapsulation they mean hiding data or details of implementation.

      This hiding is used to insulate users of software libraries from changes to the underlying code, when new versions of libraries are released.

      Inheritance can expose the hidden data or details of implementation.
