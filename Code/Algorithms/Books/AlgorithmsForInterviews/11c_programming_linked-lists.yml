      ## 11.07: Reversing a singly linked list

      Suppose you were given a singly linked list of integers sorted in ascending order and you need to return a list with the elements sorted in descending order. Suppose memory is scarce but you can reuse nodes in the original list.

      Give a linear-time nonrecursive procedure that reverses a singly linked list. The procedure should use no more than constant storage beyond that needed for the list itself.
