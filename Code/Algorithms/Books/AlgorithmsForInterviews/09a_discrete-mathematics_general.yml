      ## 09.01: Computing the binomial coefficients

      Design an efficient algorithm for computing \\(\binom{n}{k}\\) with the property that it never overflows if \\(\binom{n}{k}\\) can be represented as an `int`; assume \\(n\\) and \\(k\\) are `int`s.

      ## 09.02: Climbing stairs

      You are climbing a staircase with \\(N\\) steps. Every time you can jump over either one step or two steps.

      How many ways are there to get to the top of the staircase?

      ## 09.03: Ramsey Theory

      This problem illustrates Ramsey's theorem.

      There are six guests at a party such that any two guests either know each other or do not know each other. Prove that there is a subset of three guests who either all know each other, or all do not know each other.

      ## 09.04: 500 doors

      There are 500 closed doors off a corridor. A person walks through the corridor and opens every door. Another person walks through the corridor and closes every alternate door. Continuing in this manner, the \\(i\\)-th person comes and toggles the position of every \\(i\\)-th door starting from door \\(i\\).

      How many doors will be open at the end after the 500-th person has passed through the doors?
