      ## 09.01: Computing the binomial coefficients

      Design an efficient algorithm for computing \\(\binom{n}{k}\\) with the property that it never overflows if \\(\binom{n}{k}\\) can be represented as an `int`; assume \\(n\\) and \\(k\\) are `int`s.

      ## 09.02: Climbing stairs

      You are climbing a staircase with \\(N\\) steps. Every time you can jump over either one step or two steps.

      How many ways are there to get to the top of the staircase?
