      ## 04.12: Shortest path with fewest edges

      In the usual formulation of the shortest path problem, the number of edges in the path is not a consideration.

      Heuristically, if we did want to avoid paths with a large number of edges, we can add a small amount to the cost of each edge. However depending on the structure of the graph and the edge costs, this may not result in the shortest path.

      Design an algorithm which takes as input a graph \\(G = (V , E)\\), directed or undirected, a nonnegative cost function on \\(E\\) and vertices \\(s\\) and \\(t\\); your algorithm should output a path with the fewest edges amongst all shortest paths from \\(s\\) to \\(t\\).

      ## 04.13: Counting shortest paths

      There may be many shortest paths between two vertices in a graph. It is commonly the case that a single shortest path is required, possibly one with the fewest edges, as in Problem 4.12. Sometimes we want to know the number of shortest paths, e.g., when analyzing the structure of a Boolean function or checking the stability of a system.

      Develop an efficient algorithm that computes the number of shortest paths between vertices \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) in an undirected graph with unit cost edges.

      ## 04.14: Random directed acyclic graph

      You are given a map with a set of cities connected by roads of known lengths.

      A storm has made some roads uncrossable. For each road, you know the probability of the road being uncrossable. A given path consisting of a set of roads is considered uncrossable if any of the roads in the path is uncrossable.

      Find a path between a given pair of cities that is the minimum length path amongst all the paths for which the probability of being crossable is greater than 0.9.

      ## 04.15: Shortest paths in the presence of randomization

      You are given a map to a maze of rooms interconnected by one-way corridors. The map specifies a set of entrance rooms and a treasure room. Some of the rooms are special --- when you arrive at a special room, you are randomly transported out through one of the one-way corridors leading out of it. The map designates which rooms are special. You are also told that the way the maze is designed is that once you leave a room, there is no way of coming back to it.

      Find a strategy which gets you to the treasure room in the minimum expected time.

      ## 04.16: Traveling salesman with a choice

      Suppose you are a salesman with a set of cities to visit. If you visit city \\(i\\), you can make \\(p(i)\\) profit. The cost of going from city \\(i\\) to city \\(j\\) is \\(c(i , j) > O\\). You want to establish a route for yourself such that you start from a city, visit a set of cities, and then come back to the original city. You can choose to ignore certain cities if you like. Your objective is to maximize the ratio of profit-to-cost.

      Devise an efficient algorithm for finding a route which maximizes the ratio of the total profit to the total cost.

      ## 04.17: Road network

      The Texas Department of Transportation is considering adding a new section of highway to the Texas Highway System. Each highway section connects two cities.

      The state officials have submitted a number of proposals for the new highway --- each proposal includes the pair of cities being connected and the length of the section.

      Devise an efficient algorithm which takes the existing network, the proposals for new highways, and returns one of the proposed highways which minimizes the shortest driving distance between the cities of El Paso and Corpus Christi.

      ## 04.18: Stable assignment

      Consider a department with \\(N\\) graduate students and \\(N\\) professors. Each student has ordered all the professors based on how keen he is to work with them. Each professor has an ordered list of all the students.

      Devise an algorithm which takes the preferences of the students and the professors and pairs a student with his adviser. There should be no student-adviser pair  \\((s_0 , a_0)\\) and \\((s_l , a_1)\\) such that \\(s_0\\) prefers \\(a_1\\) to \\(a_0\\) and \\(a_1\\) prefers \\(s_0\\) to \\(s_1\\).

      ## 04.19: Arbitrage

      You are exploring the remote valleys of Papua New Guinea, one of the last uncharted places in the world. You come across a tribe that does not have money --- instead it relies on the barter system. There are \\(N\\) commodities which are traded and the exchange rates are specified by a two-dimensional matrix. For example, three sheep can be exchanged for seven goats; four goats can be exchanged for 200 pounds of wheat, etc.

      Devise an efficient algorithm to determine whether or not there exists an arbitrage --- a way to start with a single unit of some commodity \\(C\\) and convert it back to more than one unit of \\(C\\) through a sequence of exchanges. Assume there are no transaction costs, rates do not fluctuate, and that fractional quantities of items can be sold.

      ## 04.20: Birkhoff -- Von Neumann decomposition

      A crossbar is a piece of networking hardware which has a number of inputs and outputs. It can simultaneously transfer packets from inputs to outputs in a single cycle, as long as no more than one packet leaves an input and no more than one packet arrives at any given output. (Assume all packets are of the same length and take equally long to transfer.)

      You are given an \\(N \times N\\) matrix of nonnegative integers; \\(A[i , j]\\) encodes the number of packets at input \\(i\\) that need to be transferred to output \\(j\\). What is the least number of cycles needed to perform the transfer encoded by \\(A\\)?

      ## 04.21: Channel capacity

      Suppose we have the capability of transmitting one of the five symbols, \\(A,B,C,D,E\\), through a communication channel. In the absence of errors, we can communicate \\(\log_2(5)\\) bits with each symbol.

      Now, suppose the channel is noisy --- specifically, the receiver cannot differentiate between the following pairs of symbols: \\(\mathbf{\Pi} = \\{(A,B), (B,C), (C,D), (D,E), (E,A)\\}\\).

      We can still achieve error-free communication by arranging with the receiver to only transmit two out of the five symbols --- e.g., \\(A\\) and \\(O\\). We cannot transmit more than two symbols and guarantee that we do not make errors because then some pair must be in \\(\mathbf{\Pi}\\). In this fashion, we are limited to \\(\log_2(2) = 1\\) bit per symbol transmitted.

      Design a scheme for the given channel by which the transmitter and receiver can achieve more than 1 bit per symbol transmitted.

      ## 04.22: Team photo day --- 2

       This problem is a continuation of Problem 4.10, where we wanted an algorithm to find the maximum number of teams that could be put in one photograph, subject to a placement constraint.

       Design an efficient algorithm for computing the minimum number of subsets of teams so that the teams in each subset can be organized to appear in one photograph, subject to the placement constraint and each team appears in some subset.

      ## 04.23: Dancing with the stars

      You are organizing a celebrity dance charity. Specifically, a number of celebrities have offered to be partners for a ballroom dance. The general public has been invited to offer bids on how much they are willing to pay for a dance with each celebrity.

      Some rules governing the dance are:

      1. each celebrity will dance once at the most,
      2. each bidder will dance once at the most, and
      3. the celebrities and the bidders are disjoint.

      Design an algorithm for pairing bidders with celebrities to maximize the revenue from the dance.
