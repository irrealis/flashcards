      ## 04.12: Shortest path with fewest edges

      In the usual formulation of the shortest path problem, the number of edges in the path is not a consideration.

      Heuristically, if we did want to avoid paths with a large number of edges, we can add a small amount to the cost of each edge. However depending on the structure of the graph and the edge costs, this may not result in the shortest path.

      Design an algorithm which takes as input a graph \\(G = (V , E)\\), directed or undirected, a nonnegative cost function on \\(E\\) and vertices \\(s\\) and \\(t\\); your algorithm should output a path with the fewest edges amongst all shortest paths from \\(s\\) to \\(t\\).

      ## 04.13: Counting shortest paths

      There may be many shortest paths between two vertices in a graph. It is commonly the case that a single shortest path is required, possibly one with the fewest edges, as in Problem 4.12. Sometimes we want to know the number of shortest paths, e.g., when analyzing the structure of a Boolean function or checking the stability of a system.

      Develop an efficient algorithm that computes the number of shortest paths between vertices \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) in an undirected graph with unit cost edges.
