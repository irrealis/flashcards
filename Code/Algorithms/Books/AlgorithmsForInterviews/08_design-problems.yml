      ## 08.01: Mosaic

      One popular form of computer art is photomosaics where you are given a collection of images called "tiles". Then, given a target image, you want to build another image which closely approximates the target image but is actually built by juxtaposing the tiles. Here the quality of approximation is mostly defined by human perception. It is often the case that with a given set of tiles, a user may want to build several mosaics.

      How would you design a software that produces high-quality mosaics with minimal compute time?

      ## 08.02: Search engine

      Modern keyword-based search engines maintain a collection of several billion documents. One of the key computations performed by a search engine is to retrieve all the documents that contain the keywords contained in a given query. This is a nontrivial task because it must be done within few tens of milliseconds.

      In this problem, we consider a smaller version of the problem where the collection of documents can fit within the RAM of a single computer.

      Given a million documents with an average size of ten kilobytes, design a program that can efficiently return the subset of documents containing a given set of words.
