      ## 11.04: Permuting the elements of an array

      A permutation of length \\(n\\) is a 1-1 onto mapping \\(\pi\\) from \\(\\{O,1,\ldots,n-1\\}\\) to itself. We can represent a permutation using an array \\(\Pi\\): set \\(\Pi[i] = \pi(i)\\). A permutation can be applied to an array \\(A\\) of \\(n\\) elements: \\(\Pi(A)\\) is defined by \\(\Pi(A[i]) = A[\Pi[i]]\\). Applying a permutation to a given array is easy if you have additional storage to write the resulting array.

      Given an array A of integers and a permutation \\(\Pi\\), compute \\(\Pi(A)\\) using only constant additional storage.

      ## 11.05: Invert a permutation

      Every 1-1 onto mapping is invertible, i.e., if \\(f\\) is 1-1 onto, then there exists a unique function \\(f^{-1}\\) such that \\(f^{-1}(f(x)) = x\\). In particular, for any permutation \\(\Pi\\), there exists a unique permutation \\(\Pi^{-1}\\) that is the inverse of \\(\Pi\\).

      Given a permutation represented by an array \\(A\\), you can compute its inverse \\(B\\) by simply assigning \\(B[A[i]] = i\\) for all values of \\(i\\).

      Given an array \\(A\\) of ints representing a permutation \\(\Pi\\), update \\(A\\) to represent \\(\Pi^{-1}\\) using only constant additional storage.
