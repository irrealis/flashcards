      ### Response:

      Most modern fields of endeavor are sufficiently mature to direct contributors' future efforts. Physics and mathematics, for example, provide ample pools of open questions whose answers are expected to prove significant. Thus, for the most part, prior achievements strongly influence subsequent contribution. Yet in every field there can be and are significant contributions that lack strong influence by past achievements in that field. Such contributions occur at boundaries defined by the creation of new fields.

      With few exceptions, new fields are strongly influenced by achievements in related fields. The reason is simple: when possible, reuse of existing knowledge and skill is more efficient than starting from scratch. Thus space exploration adapts rocketry created for war, cavalry adapts animal husbandry from agriculture, and computational biology refines both biology and computer science.

      Of course, the boundary at a field's creation may be unclear. One may ask, when did computer science come into being? The Babbage difference engine? Lovelace's first algorithm? The von Neumann machine? For that matter, can a contribution to a field come before its creation? Can it then become significant? For if the realization of the von Neumann machine marks the birth of computer science, then Lovelace's historic first algorithm precedes the field to which it contributed.

      The boundary between related fields may also be unclear. Are physics and computer science both continuations of mathematics? Is computational biology a continuation of both computer science and biology? But what, then, distinguishes physics from biology?

      One may also object that there must have been a first field, one lacking antecedent influence --- perhaps the discovery of fire, or the planting of the first crop. One might respond that agriculture and fire both extend the endeavor of subsistence, which is be as old as life itself; and that that rocketry extends use of fire, cavalry extends animal husbandry extends agriculture, and so on, whence it follows that all endeavors are one.

      The point here is not reductio ad absurdum, but that delineation between fields of endeavor requires breaking the chain of deductions before it becomes absurd. To the extent that we distinguish between space exploration and horseback riding, to the same extent we must admit the foundations of these endeavors, and thus their first accomplishments. That is, there can be significant contributions to a field that are influenced by no prior accomplishments in that field.


      ## Notes on construction:

      ### Restated issue:
      - \\(\forall\\) fields of endeavor,
      - \\(\forall\\) contributors to that field,
      - \\(\forall\\) significant contributions by that contributor to that field,
      - \\(\exists\\) achievements within that field,
      - Such that:
        - The achievements influence the contributor,
        - And this influence is strong,
        - And this influence occurs before the contribution,
        - And the contribution requires this influence.

      ### Questions this answers:
      - By what means is it possible to make a significant contribution to a field of endeavor?

      #### Thoughts:
      - Can there be new knowledge/achievements that build on knowledge/achievements from entirely different fields?
        - What about the founding of a new field?
          - If all knowledge/achievements build on previous knowledge/achievements, then:
            - The influence would come from a related field. What's distinguishes fields from one another?
      - Can the influence be weak?
      - Can the influencing achievement occur after the contribution?
        - Could a past contribution become significant due to a subsequent achievement?

      ### Opposite viewpoint:
      - \\(\exist\\) fields of endeavor,
      - \\(\exist\\) contributors to that field,
      - \\(\exist\\) significant contributions by that contributor to that field,
      - \\(\forall\\) achievements within that field,
      - Such that:
        - The achievements do not influence the contributor,
        - Or this influence is weak,
        - Or this influence occurs after the contribution,
        - Or the contribution does not require this influence.

      _It is possible in some fields of endeavor to make significant contributions without first being strongly influenced by past achievements in that field._

      #### Thoughts:

      To make a useful contribution to some field of endeavor, sufficient understanding of that field is required to understand how the contribution can be of use.

      To every achievement strongly influenced by prior work, that prior work contributes.

      Every new field has an initial contribution, but no prior achievement in that field.

      With few exceptions, all new fields are strongly influenced by achievements in related fields.

      Can argue all new fields are simply refinements, thus not distinct.
      - Rocket science derives from discovery of fire
      - Cuisine from basic endeavor of finding food

      Exceptions may include humanity's earliest discoveries.
      - Discovery of fire
      - Animal husbandry
      - Agriculture

      Can even argue that all endeavors are refinements of a single field, that of subsistence.

      Point: not reductio ad absurdum by following deductive chain to logical conclusion, but to demonstrate that breaking chain requires delineating related endeavors to sep fields.

      To same extent, must acknowledge that the initial contribution to a new field is influenced solely by achievements in related but distinct fields.

      ### Alternate viewpoints:


      ### Outline:

      Intro: _It is possible in some fields of endeavor to make significant contributions without first being strongly influenced by past achievements in that field._

      To make a useful contribution to some field of endeavor, sufficient understanding of that field is required to understand how the contribution can be of use.

      Body 1: With few exceptions, all new fields are strongly influenced by achievements in related fields.

      Exceptions may include humanity's earliest discoveries.
      - Discovery of fire
      - Animal husbandry and agriculture

      Body 2: Can argue every new field simply refinemes or adapts existing field, thus not distinct.
      - Space exploration adapts rocketry created for warfare
      - Cavalry adapts the agricultural purpose of animal husbandry

      Body 3: Can even argue that all endeavors are refinements of a single field, that of subsistence.
      - Rocket science derives from discovery of fire
      - Agriculture from basic endeavor of finding food
      - Eating and

      Point: not reductio ad absurdum by following deductive chain to logical conclusion, but to demonstrate that breaking chain requires delineating related endeavors to sep fields.

      Body 4: It is possible for new achievements in a field to make a prior contribution significant.
      - First algorithm, Ada Lovelace

      Conclusion: To same extent, must acknowledge that the initial contribution to a new field is influenced solely by achievements in related but distinct fields.

      ### Thesis:

      (The premise that significant contributions to any field of endeavor must be strongly influenced by past achievements in that field holds true with few exceptions. ...)


      ### Paragraph topic sentences:

      Body 1:
      - Topic: new fields have first contribution but no antecedent; are new fields distinct from related fields?

        By the same token, with few exceptions, every new field is strongly influenced by achievements in related fields. ...

      Can argue that because the founding contribution simply refines or adapts achievements of related fields, the new field must also be a refinement or adaptation, and not really distinct.
      - Rocket science ultimately derives from discovery of fire
      - Cuisine from basic endeavor of finding food

      Body 2:
      - Topic: some of earliest fields may not have antecedents

        Of course, some of humanity's earliest discoveries must lack influence by antecedent achievements in any field.
        - Discovery of fire
        - Animal husbandry
        - Agriculture

      Body 3:
      - Topic: all fields are same? must break logic.

        It could further be argued that that all endeavors are refinements of a single field, that of subsistence, but this reductio ad absurdum strains credulity. ...

      Conclusion: To same extent, must acknowledge that the initial contribution to a new field is influenced solely by achievements in related but distinct fields.

      - Context: Most fields of endeavor are sufficiently mature to direct contributors' future efforts.
